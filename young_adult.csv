0,"Yo, so this 42-year-old dude on a mission in southeast Asia has had his nuts gradually getting bigger and it's been going on for over 2 years now. His fam doesn't have a history of cancer or inheritable diseases. He smokes about 2 packs a day for 20 years and has had some fevers that went away on their own. The doc checked him out and everything seems normal except for his left ball being larger and glowing when you shine light through it. What's causing this dude's swollen ball situation?","*1* The most likely cause for this dude's swollen ball situation is testicular cancer. The gradual enlargement of one testicle, especially with the presence of a mass that appears to glow when light is shined through it, is highly indicative of testicular cancer. 
*2* Another possible cause could be a hydrocele, which is a buildup of fluid around the testicle that can cause swelling. However, the glowing appearance when light is shined through the testicle makes this less likely. 
*3* The smoking history and the presence of fevers that resolved on their own could also point towards a possible infection, such as epididymitis. However, the persistent swelling over 2 years and the glowing appearance of the testicle make testicular cancer a more likely explanation.",Decreased lymphatic fluid absorption,Relevant
1,"Yo, so you just had a C-section three days ago and now you're dealing with some funky discharge and still bleeding a lot? Plus, it's hurting when you pee? You also had a bad kidney infection during your pregnancy and you have a history of anxiety and skin issues. Your temperature is a bit high, your pulse is fast, and you're feeling sweaty. Your postpartum situation is definitely not the best right now. What should we do next to help you out?","1. You should seek immediate medical attention. Given the symptoms of funky discharge, heavy bleeding, pain when urinating, history of kidney infection, high temperature, fast pulse, and feeling sweaty, it is essential to consult a healthcare provider as soon as possible.

2. It is important to mention your history of kidney infections and anxiety to the healthcare provider, as these factors may contribute to the current symptoms and treatment plan.

3. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and rest as much as possible while awaiting medical evaluation.",Clindamycin and gentamicin,Inaccurate.
2,"Yo, this 19-year-old guy fainted while helping his girl move furniture and she freaked out. His blood pressure is all normal, but he's been feeling dizzy at the gym. The doc heard some heart murmurs that go away when his legs are up. What could be causing all this?","*1* The most plausible explanation for the fainting, dizziness, and heart murmur that improve with elevation of the legs is a condition called orthostatic hypotension. This occurs when there is a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up from a lying or sitting position, leading to symptoms such as dizziness and fainting.

*2* Another possible cause could be a heart condition such as mitral valve prolapse, where the valve between the upper and lower chambers of the left side of the heart does not close properly, leading to abnormal blood flow and heart murmurs. This condition can sometimes lead to symptoms such as dizziness and fainting.

*3* Lastly, the symptoms could also be attributed to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances, which can occur during intense physical activity like moving furniture or working out at the gym. These imbalances can affect blood pressure regulation and lead to symptoms such as dizziness and fainting.",Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Relevant
3,"Yo, so this 27-year-old chick is 20 weeks pregnant and has had seizures a few times already during her pregnancy. She used to take valproic acid for her seizures but stopped when she got pregnant. She ain't into meds much and usually sees a shaman for her health stuff. After being in the hospital recently, she's cool with starting carbamazepine. What's the best move for treating her right now?","*1* 1. **Urgent initiation of carbamazepine**: Carbamazepine is generally considered safer than valproic acid during pregnancy, as valproic acid is known to have teratogenic effects. It can be effective in controlling seizures without posing as high a risk to the fetus.
  
*2* 2. **Regular monitoring of drug levels and fetal well-being**: Since this pregnant woman has a history of seizures and is now starting a new medication, it is important to monitor both the levels of the drug in her system to ensure efficacy and prevent toxicity, as well as monitor the well-being of the fetus to ensure the medication is not causing harm.
  
*3* 3. **Consider additional non-pharmacological therapies**: Given the patient's preferences for non-medical treatments, it may be beneficial to explore and incorporate complementary therapies such as acupuncture or mindfulness techniques to help manage her seizures alongside the carbamazepine, under the guidance of her healthcare provider.",Folate,Inaccurate
4,"Hey, so this woman's got some swelling in her legs and arms after being treated for high blood pressure. What's the next move the doc should make to help her out?","*1* The doctor should assess for signs of fluid overload or congestive heart failure, as these conditions can manifest as swelling in the arms and legs. Adjusting her high blood pressure medication regimen may be necessary.

*2* The doctor should check for any signs of drug-induced edema caused by the high blood pressure medication. Switching to a different medication or adjusting the dosage may be needed to alleviate the swelling.

*3* The doctor may also consider evaluating for side effects of other medications the patient may be taking that could be contributing to the swelling in her arms and legs.",Lisinopril,Relevant.
5,"Yo, this 42-year-old dude has been havin' a hard time catchin' his breath when he's gettin' his sweat on for the past 6 months. He's got systemic sclerosis diagnosed 5 years back. The doctor saw his pulse and all is cool. His skin on his fingers is lookin' puffy and tight. Lungs seem fine during the checkup. No weird veins poppin' out of his neck. Chest x-ray showed big blood vessels in the lungs and a fat right side of the heart. Heart test showed high pressure in the right ventricle and a mean lung artery pressure of 55 mm Hg. They started him on tadalafil meds. Why is this drug gonna help him out the most?","1. The patient is most likely experiencing pulmonary hypertension due to systemic sclerosis. Tadalafil is a medication that belongs to a class called phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. It works by dilating the blood vessels in the lungs and decreasing the workload of the heart by reducing pulmonary artery pressure. This helps in improving exercise capacity and symptoms in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

2. Tadalafil can also help in improving symptoms related to erectile dysfunction, which can be common in patients with systemic sclerosis.

3. Tadalafil may have a vasodilatory effect on other blood vessels in the body, potentially providing some relief from symptoms related to Raynaud's phenomenon, a condition commonly associated with systemic sclerosis.",Enhanced activity of nitric oxide,Relevant
6,"Yo, so this 17-year-old dude keeps getting gnarly acne that won't budge no matter what his mom tries. They're worried it'll scar his face up. He's healthy otherwise, just struggling in school and always getting into trouble. And get this - he's a giant, way taller than his fam. His skin's all inflamed with zits on his face, shoulders, and chest. Could you tell me which karyotype matches up with all this?","1. Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) - This genetic condition is characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males, leading to various physical and developmental symptoms, including tall stature, gynecomastia (enlarged breast tissue), and acne.
2. Turner syndrome (45, X) - This genetic disorder affects females and is characterized by the absence of one X chromosome. Symptoms can include short stature, webbed neck, and puffiness in the hands and feet. While acne is not a common symptom, it can occur in individuals with Turner syndrome.
3. Normal male karyotype (46, XY) - Without any specific genetic abnormality, acne in adolescents, especially in the described areas, can be a common occurrence due to hormonal changes during puberty. However, the presence of acne alone does not typically indicate a specific karyotype.",47 XYY,Relevant.
7,"Yo, so like this dude is 72 and he's been having a hard time hearing, especially when there's mad noise around. He also has this ringing in his ears and gets dizzy sometimes. Dude had like 3 ear infections in the past and his pops had cholesteatoma. When they put a tuning fork by his ear, air conduction was better than bone conduction. What's prob causing all this?","*1* The most likely cause of the symptoms described in this scenario is Meniere's disease, a condition characterized by episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and a feeling of fullness in the affected ear. Meniere's disease commonly affects individuals between the ages of 40 and 60, but cases have been reported in older individuals as well. The presence of a family history of ear issues (such as cholesteatoma in the father) can also be a risk factor. The tuning fork test confirmed sensorineural hearing loss, which is characteristic of Meniere's disease.

*2* Another possible cause could be otosclerosis, a condition where abnormal bone growth in the middle ear can lead to hearing loss. Otosclerosis is more common in young to middle-aged adults, however, it can also affect older individuals. The tuning fork test showing air conduction better than bone conduction could be indicative of conductive hearing loss associated with otosclerosis.

*3* Chronic suppurative otitis media could also be a potential cause given the history of recurrent ear infections. This condition is characterized by persistent ear discharge, hearing loss, and possible damage to the middle ear structures. However, the presence of vertigo and tinnitus in this case makes Meniere's disease a more likely explanation.",Cochlear hair cell degeneration,Relevant
8,"Yo, so you're saying that this dude found out about a 2 cm nodule in his lung during a check-up and didn't even feel anything weird before that? And the doctor is telling him that lung cancers can be sneaky and not cause symptoms until they've already done some damage? Sounds wild. What's the doctor trying to explain to this guy here?","1. The doctor is likely trying to explain to the person that some lung cancers can be asymptomatic in the early stages, and by the time symptoms do appear, the cancer may have already advanced.

2. The doctor may also be trying to convey that lung nodules are common incidental findings on imaging tests and are often benign, but further evaluation is needed to rule out malignancy.

3. The doctor may mention that early detection of lung cancer through routine screenings or incidental findings like lung nodules can improve treatment outcomes and prognosis.",Latent period,Relevant
9,"Hey there! So, based on this situation, what do you think is the most likely diagnosis for this 24-year-old woman? 🤔",I'd be happy to help! Could you please provide me with the details of the situation for the 24-year-old woman?,Common variable immunodeficiency,inaccurate
10,"Yo, so this 33-year-old chick has been dealing with lower belly pains, diarrhea, feeling bloated, and a bit queasy for like 4 months now. She's also lost some weight (11 lbs to be exact) and feels like she can't fully take a dump. She's healthy otherwise, eats lots of fiber, and her dad is Ashkenazi Jewish. She seems fine during her check-up, with a normal temp, pulse, and blood pressure. Lungs and heart sound okay, but her tummy is a bit tender in the lower right side. Stool test came back negative for hidden blood. Her blood work shows low hemoglobin, high white blood cell and platelet counts, and a fast erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Barium enema showed ulcers and narrowing in the right colon. What's the most likely diagnosis here?","1. Crohn's disease: Given the symptoms of lower belly pains, diarrhea, bloating, weight loss, and the findings of ulcers and narrowing in the right colon on the barium enema, Crohn's disease is the most likely diagnosis. The elevated white blood cell counts, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and family history of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are also indicative of Crohn's disease.

2. Ulcerative colitis: Although the presentation is more consistent with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis is another possibility due to the abdominal symptoms and findings of ulcers on the barium enema. However, the presence of ulcers and narrowing in the right colon makes Crohn's disease more likely.

3. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): IBS can present with similar symptoms such as lower belly pains, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. However, the significant weight loss, abnormal blood work, and imaging findings make IBS less likely in this case.",Crohn disease,Accurate.
11,"Dude, the guy who fell off a two-story building is recovering from a massive brain surgery. He's hooked up on a ventilator and getting fluids through IV. What should we do now to make sure he's getting the right nutrition to recover well?","1. Consult with a registered dietitian or nutritionist who can assess the patient's nutritional needs and develop a personalized feeding plan to ensure adequate intake of essential nutrients for recovery.

2. Consider starting enteral nutrition (tube feeding) if the patient is unable to eat by mouth and their gut is functional. Enteral nutrition can provide a well-balanced diet directly into the stomach or small intestine.

3. Monitor the patient's weight, laboratory values, and clinical status regularly and make adjustments to the nutrition plan as needed to support the healing process.",Enteral feeding via nasogastric tube,Relevant
12,"Yo, this kid keeps getting this super itchy rash on his knees, elbows, and eyelids. His skin and hair look kinda pale, and he's giving off a funky smell in his sweat and pee. His mom says this rash has been coming and going since he was a baby. What kind of grub should we suggest for him based on all this?","1. Iron-rich foods such as red meat, poultry, fish, lentils, and fortified cereals to address the possibility of iron deficiency anemia.
2. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids like salmon, walnuts, and flaxseeds to help with skin inflammation.
3. Probiotic-rich foods like yogurt to potentially improve gut health and reduce skin irritations.",Avoid meat,Accurate
13,"Yo, so like this dude's old and he's been dealing with high blood pressure for like forever and is taking a bunch of meds for it. His BP is 150/100 mm Hg and everything else seems normal. The heart test showed some stuff going on in the left ventricle. What's up with that?","*1*1. The left ventricle may be experiencing hypertrophy due to the long-term high blood pressure. This is a common adaptation the heart makes to pump against increased resistance from high blood pressure.
*2*2. The left ventricle may be showing signs of diastolic dysfunction, which is a common complication of untreated or poorly controlled high blood pressure. This occurs when the heart is unable to relax properly between contractions, affecting its ability to fill with blood.
*3*3. The left ventricle may be showing signs of concentric remodeling, which is another adaptation the heart makes to prolonged high blood pressure. This involves thickening of the ventricular walls without enlargement of the chamber size.",Increase in cardiac cell size,Relevant

15,"Yo, so this 5-year-old dude just moved from Nebraska and his mom's worried about his development 'cause he can only say short sentences and is behind on his ABCs. He's always zoning out and seems to be lagging. All he wants to do is play with his cars. Physically, he's well-fed but with weak eye contact, a noticeable jaw, a single crease in his palm, and big balls. What's the deal with this kid's situation?","1. He may have Fragile X syndrome, a genetic disorder that can cause delays in speech and language development, as well as intellectual disability. Children with Fragile X syndrome may also exhibit social anxiety, poor eye contact, and hyperactivity, as well as physical features such as a prominent jaw, single crease in the palm, and macroorchidism (enlarged testicles). The child's preference for playing with cars can also indicate repetitive behaviors, which are common in Fragile X syndrome.

2. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is another possibility given his delayed language skills, preference for solitary play with objects, and zoning out behavior. Children with ASD may also exhibit weak eye contact and repetitive behaviors. However, the physical features described (such as a prominent jaw and macroorchidism) are more characteristic of Fragile X syndrome.

3. Developmental delay could be a broad explanation for the child's symptoms, including delays in speech, language, and cognitive development. However, the combination of physical features described, along with the specific behavioral traits, make a syndromic condition like Fragile X syndrome or ASD more likely in this case.",CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion,Relevant
16,"Yo, dude, this 65-year-old guy with a lot of health stuff going on shows up at the ER with shortness of breath and chest pain that's been getting worse for the past 3 days. He's been coughing up stinky mucus for a week too. This dude has gastritis, advanced Parkinson's, used to smoke a pack a day for 40 years (but quit 5 years ago), and had a long history of heavy drinking (also quit drinking 5 years ago). He's running a fever of 39.3°C, and his oxygen level is low at 77% on room air. His lung sounds are not good on the right upper side. The guy's labs show a high white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and high lactic acid levels. The chest x-ray shows something in his right upper lung. Out of all that, what's the biggest reason for his breathing problems?","1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, productive cough, fever, and abnormal lung sounds on exam, along with the finding on chest x-ray of a lung infiltrate, pneumonia is the most likely cause.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: Considering the patient's history of Parkinson's disease and possible impaired swallowing function, he may have aspirated (inhaled) oral or gastric contents leading to aspiration pneumonia. This can explain the presence of stinky mucus, fever, and abnormal lung sounds.

3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbation: The patient's history of long-term smoking, although he quit 5 years ago, puts him at risk for COPD. However, the rapid progression of symptoms over the past 3 days, along with the fever and abnormal chest x-ray findings, make pneumonia a more likely diagnosis in this acute setting.","Parkinson disease

17,"Yo, this dude got shanked and now he's in the ER. The doc checked him out and found a 4-cm cut on his right forearm. The MRI shows a nerve messed up between some muscles. Which part of his arm is probably numb now?","*1* The ulnar nerve is most likely affected, leading to numbness on the ulnar side of the forearm and hand.
*2* The radial nerve is the second most likely nerve that could be affected, leading to numbness on the back of the hand and forearm.
*3* The median nerve is the third most likely nerve that could be affected, leading to numbness on the palm side of the hand.",Fingertip of the index finger,Relevant
18,"Yo, so this dude hasn't been feeling too hot for like 4 months now - super tired and not hungry at all. He had a kidney transplant from a fam member 5 years back and now takes sirolimus and mycophenolate. His blood pressure is a bit high at 150/95. Tests show he has anemia and a creatinine level of 3.1 mg/dL, which is higher than 6 months ago when everything was chill. What's probably causing his creatinine levels to spike like that?","*1* The most plausible reason for the spike in creatinine levels in this patient who has had a kidney transplant and is taking immunosuppressive medications like sirolimus and mycophenolate is *tacrolimus toxicity*. Tacrolimus is another immunosuppressive drug commonly used after kidney transplant, and levels of the medication need to be carefully monitored to prevent toxicity, which can lead to kidney damage.

*2* Another possible reason for the elevated creatinine levels could be *renal artery stenosis*. This is a condition where the arteries supplying blood to the kidneys become narrowed, leading to decreased blood flow and potential kidney damage. Given that the patient's blood pressure is high, this could be a contributing factor to his kidney function issues.

*3* A third plausible reason for the spike in creatinine levels in this patient could be *acute rejection of the transplanted kidney*. Even though the transplant was done 5 years ago, rejection can still occur at any time. The combination of anemia, elevated creatinine levels, and a history of kidney transplant raises concerns for potential rejection as a cause of his symptoms.",CD4+ T cell-mediated intimal smooth muscle proliferation,Relevant
19,You at risk for what probz in the long run after taking those folate supplements and seeing those lab changes?,"*1* You may be at risk for masking a vitamin B12 deficiency. Folate supplementation can improve certain lab values but not correct the deficiency itself, leading to the possibility of neurological damage from untreated B12 deficiency.

*2* You may be at risk for hyperhomocysteinemia. Folate supplementation can lower homocysteine levels in the body, but if other nutrients like B12 and B6 are deficient, it can lead to high levels of homocysteine which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.

*3* You may be at risk for developing hypothyroidism. High levels of folate in the body have been associated with interfering with the absorption of thyroid medication or affecting thyroid function in individuals with underlying thyroid conditions.",Peripheral neuropathy,Relevant
20,"Hey, so this 30-year-old chick gained like 5 kg (11 lb) in the past 3 months, is feeling mad constipated, always cold, and noticed her hair is thinning. She's been taking the pill for a few months and is on point with it. Her vitals are all good and her lab results show:
Total T4: 25 ug/dL
Free T4: 0.8 ng/dL
TSH: 0.2 mU/L
What's the main way the pill she's taking is messing with her body to cause these symptoms?","*1* 1. The birth control pill may be causing an increase in thyroid binding globulin (TBG), leading to an increase in total T4 levels while the free T4 (biologically active form) remains normal. This can result in symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as weight gain, constipation, feeling cold, and hair thinning.

*2* 2. The pill might be interfering with the conversion of T4 (inactive form) to T3 (active form) in the body, leading to a decrease in free T4 levels and subsequently causing symptoms of hypothyroidism.

*3* 3. The pill may be affecting the feedback loop of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, resulting in a low TSH level despite low free T4 levels. This can create symptoms of hypothyroidism due to inadequate stimulation of the thyroid gland.",Inhibition of hormones in the pituitary gland,Relevant
21,"Yo, so like, this dude is 62 and he's having trouble sleeping. He keeps waking up all night and then gets up way too early feeling tired af. This has been going on for 7 months now and he's tired of it. He's dealing with high blood pressure and an enlarged prostate but never smoked and doesn't drink alcohol or caffeine before bed. His temp is 36.6°C (97.8°F), BP is 130/80, and heart rate is 77/min. Physical exam is normal. We talked about improving his sleep habits, so what's the next move for helping him out?","1. Consider conducting a sleep study to evaluate for sleep disorders such as sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a common condition in older adults and can disrupt sleep, leading to poor quality sleep and daytime fatigue.

2. Discuss the possibility of medication-induced insomnia, especially if the patient is taking medications for his high blood pressure or other conditions. Some medications can disrupt sleep patterns and cause insomnia.

3. Screen for depression or anxiety, as these mental health conditions can also contribute to insomnia. It is important to address any underlying psychological factors that may be affecting the patient's sleep.",Zolpidem,Inaccurate.
22,"Yo, so like, what kind of antibiotic would make these bacteria swell up and burst after being in a hypotonic saline solution?","1. **Penicillin**: Penicillin acts by inhibiting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, causing the bacteria to weaken and burst in a hypotonic environment.
2. **Cephalosporins**: Cephalosporins also target the bacterial cell wall, leading to a similar effect in a hypotonic environment.
3. **Vancomycin**: Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that disrupts cell wall synthesis, potentially leading to bursting in a hypotonic saline solution, but it is not as effective as penicillin or cephalosporins in this regard.",Cephalosporin,Accurate.

25,"Yo, so like, what's the name of the fungus that's gotten into this dude after his lung transplant?","*1* The most plausible answer is Aspergillus fumigatus, a common fungus responsible for causing infections in immunocompromised individuals, such as those who have undergone solid organ transplants.

*2* Candida albicans, another common fungal pathogen that can cause infections in immunocompromised individuals, including those who have had solid organ transplants.

*3* Pneumocystis jirovecii, a fungus that can cause pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals, but it is more commonly associated with HIV/AIDS patients and not specifically lung transplant recipients.",Coccidioides species,Accurate
26,Is it possible that this lil baby's symptoms could be due to a certain condition with these lab results?,"1. **Yes**, the symptoms could be due to a certain condition based on the lab results.

28,"Yo, this little dude was born and his mom had some symptoms during pregnancy. What congenital heart issue is he most likely dealing with based on this info and the retinal exam in the pic?","Based on the information provided and the retinal exam in the picture showing a cherry-red spot, the most likely congenital heart issue the child is dealing with is:

*1* - Tay-Sachs disease, a rare genetic disorder that results in the deficiency of an enzyme necessary to break down lipids in nerve cells. This leads to progressive neurological deterioration and a cherry-red spot on the retina is a classic finding in the infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease.

*2* - Fabry disease, a rare genetic disorder that results in the build-up of a particular type of fat in the body's cells. It can lead to various symptoms including kidney problems and heart issues, but it is not commonly associated with a cherry-red spot on the retina.

*3* - Gaucher disease, a rare genetic disorder that results in the build-up of fatty substances in cells and certain organs. It can lead to an enlarged liver and spleen, but it is not commonly associated with a cherry-red spot on the retina.",Patent ductus arteriosus,Inaccurate
29,"Yo, do you know what's up with this rough, scaly patch on this lady's hand? Any guesses on the diagnosis?","*1* This rough, scaly patch on the lady's hand could potentially be a symptom of eczema (also known as atopic dermatitis), a common skin condition characterized by dry, itchy, and inflamed skin. The scaly appearance could be from the skin drying out and thickening in response to inflammation.

*2* Another possibility could be psoriasis, which is a chronic autoimmune condition that causes rapid skin cell growth, resulting in thick, scaly patches on the skin.

*3* Lastly, it may also be a manifestation of contact dermatitis, which occurs when the skin comes into contact with an irritant or allergen, leading to skin irritation, redness, and scaling.",Actinic keratosis,Relevant
30,"Hey, 34-year-old lady feeling exhausted lately, gaining 7 pounds, and dealing with constipation, muscle pains, and feeling extra chilly. Doc found delayed reflexes. Vital signs seem alright. What's the best test to start figuring this out?","1. Comprehensive thyroid panel to check for hypothyroidism, given the symptoms of weight gain, constipation, muscle pains, feeling chilly, and delayed reflexes.

He's cool with his relationship but has noticed his sex drive's down and feels awkward about his performance. Dude injured his lower back a year ago in a car crash. He's on meds for bipolar but doesn't know which ones. Doc finds his balls are small, but everything else down there seems normal. What's likely causing his symptoms?","1. Hypogonadism: Given the presentation of small testicles, low libido, erectile dysfunction, and the history of a car crash that could have possibly resulted in testicular trauma, hypogonadism appears to be the most likely cause of his symptoms.

2. Side effects of bipolar medication: The medication being taken for bipolar disorder could also be contributing to his erectile dysfunction and reduced libido. Certain medications used to manage bipolar disorder, such as antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, can impact sexual functioning.

3. Lumbar spine injury: The lower back injury from the car crash may be affecting the nerves that control sexual function. Damage to the lumbar spine can sometimes lead to erectile dysfunction and reduced libido. It is important to explore the potential impact of this injury on his symptoms.",Decreased testosterone levels,Accurate

She's on metformin, naproxen, calcium with D3. She had a clean colonoscopy at 50. She looks pale and sweaty. Her temp is 36°C (96.8°F), heart rate is 110/min, breaths are 20/min, BP is 90/50 mm Hg. Her O2 sat is at 98%. Her belly feels soft with slight pain in the upper part. Rectal check shows dark stool. They've hooked her up with IVs and fluids. What's the move now, doc?","1. The most plausible diagnosis would be a gastrointestinal bleed, possibly from a peptic ulcer or diverticulosis, given the symptoms of weak, dark stools, and the presence of pale appearance, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient's age, history of leg swelling, joint problems, diabetes, and family history of colon cancer also put her at increased risk for GI bleeds.

2. In this case, a possible complication to consider could be an acute kidney injury resulting from hypoperfusion due to the hypotension seen in the patient. The combination of medications she is on, along with her medical conditions, could predispose her to renal issues.

3. It would also be important to rule out other possible causes of upper abdominal pain and dark stools, such as pancreatitis or even an aortic dissection, given the patient's age and risk factors. Additional diagnostic tests, such as blood work for pancreatic enzymes and imaging studies, may be warranted.",Esophagogastroduodenoscopy,Relevant
37,"Yo, this older dude comes in complaining of pain while walking. The worst is in his left big toe but he also feels it in his hips and knees. He says it's worse when he's up and about but gets better when he chills out. This pain has been getting worse over the past few years. His health history includes being obese, having type 2 diabetes, smoking, and high blood pressure. Plus, he's downing about ten brewskis a day. He's on metformin, insulin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. Dude recently went to Bangkok and admits to unprotected action. During a check-up, his lower body hurts when touched. There's some crackling in his hip when he moves his thigh back and forth. What do you think is the most likely diagnosis here?","1. Gout: This older individual presents with symptoms consistent with gout, such as pain in his left big toe (a common location for gout), worsening pain while walking, and improvement when at rest. The presence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and excessive alcohol consumption are all risk factors for gout. The recent unprotected sexual activity may have also put him at risk for contracting certain infections that could trigger gout. The tenderness and crackling in the hip could suggest joint involvement commonly seen in gout.

2. Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis is another possible diagnosis given the patient's age, obesity, and chronic pain that worsens with activity. Osteoarthritis commonly affects weight-bearing joints like the knees and hips, which aligns with the patient's symptoms. The crackling in the hip joint could also be indicative of osteoarthritis.

3. Peripheral artery disease (PAD): Considering the patient's smoking history, diabetes, and increasing pain with activity (claudication), PAD is another plausible diagnosis. The pain in the lower extremities that improves with rest is characteristic of PAD. The history of high blood pressure can also be a contributing risk factor for PAD. Touch sensitivity in the lower body could suggest compromised blood flow as seen in PAD.",Osteoarthritis,Relevant
38,"Yo, so this healthy 30-year-old dude has been dealing with weird bumps on his elbows for like 2 weeks now. He's never really been sick before and doesn't take any meds. The doc saw these bumps during the exam. They even showed a pic of his right elbow. What's the best way to treat his skin probs?","*1* The most likely diagnosis for the bumps on the elbows is a condition called *psoriasis*. This is a chronic skin condition that can cause red, raised patches with silvery scales. It commonly affects the elbows and knees. Treatment usually involves topical corticosteroids, moisturizers, and phototherapy.

*2* Another possibility could be *contact dermatitis*, which is inflammation of the skin caused by contact with irritants or allergens. Treatment involves identifying and avoiding the triggering substance, along with topical corticosteroids and antihistamines if needed.

*3* A less likely but possible diagnosis might be *eczema*, which can cause red, itchy, and inflamed skin. Treatment includes moisturizers, corticosteroids, and avoiding triggers like harsh soaps or allergens.",Calcipotriene,Relevant.
39,"Dude, this 32-year-old guy took a nasty fall onto a wooden post and now he's in mad pain, breathing fast, and his pulse is through the roof. The doc found an impact wound on his left side and can't hear any breath sounds over his left lung. What's the most likely problem here?","*1* He most likely has a tension pneumothorax, which is an emergency condition where air enters the pleural space and cannot escape, causing the affected lung to collapse and putting pressure on the heart and other lung. This can lead to difficulty breathing, fast breathing, increased heart rate, chest pain, and reduced lung sounds on the affected side. Immediate treatment is required to relieve the pressure and restore normal lung function.

*2* Another possibility could be a hemothorax, where blood fills the space between the lungs and chest wall, usually due to trauma. This can also cause chest pain, difficulty breathing, and reduced breath sounds on the affected side. It is important to address the bleeding and manage the patient's respiratory status.

*3* A rib fracture could be contributing to the symptoms as well, especially if he took a hard fall onto a wooden post. Rib fractures can be extremely painful and can lead to difficulty breathing due to the sharp edges of the broken rib potentially injuring the lung tissue. However, the absence of breath sounds over the left lung is more indicative of a pneumothorax or hemothorax in this case.",Hemothorax,Relevant
40,"Yo, after getting my heart checked 'cause of a heart attack, I'm getting some weird pain in my toes. They did some stuff with stents and arteries during the procedure. I've got high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and bad heart arteries. My meds include metoprolol, enalapril, atorvastatin, and aspirin. Why am I suddenly getting toe pain after the heart procedure?","1. The most plausible reason for experiencing toe pain after a heart procedure could be a condition called peripheral artery disease (PAD). This is a circulatory problem where narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to your limbs, causing pain and discomfort in the extremities like the toes.

2. Another plausible explanation could be a side effect of one of your medications, particularly atorvastatin. Some individuals may experience muscle pain, weakness, or cramps in different parts of the body, including the toes, as a side effect of statin medications like atorvastatin.

3. Lastly, the toe pain could be related to a complication from the heart procedure, such as a blood clot or nerve damage. It's essential to speak with your healthcare provider to rule out any serious concerns and explore potential treatment options to alleviate the discomfort.",Acute kidney injury,Inaccurate. 
41,"Yo yo! So like, this woman is 49 and she's been gettin' some unpleasant feelings when she pees and she's peeing a lot. She's never had a UTI before but her mom gets 'em a lot. She's got some health stuff goin' on too like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cervical cancer, and high cholesterol. She smokes a pack a day and drinks wine but no drugs. Her vital signs are normal though. She's got a murmur and pain in her lower belly. Her pee test shows a bunch of white blood cells and stuff. Which of these things wouldn't make a UTI more complicated?","1. Smoking a pack a day.
2. Having a murmur and pain in the lower belly.
3. Family history of UTIs.",The causative organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Inaccurate.
42,"Dude, a 58-year-old guy had a major seizure and has been dealing with a dry cough for half a year! He's been losing weight and feels tired a lot. Not on meds, but smokes a pack a day for like forever. Also, his sodium levels are low and his chest x-ray looks funky. What could be causing all this?","*1* The most plausible answer for the symptoms described in this scenario is Small Cell Lung Cancer. Small Cell Lung Cancer is commonly associated with symptoms like coughing, weight loss, fatigue, and electrolyte imbalances such as low sodium levels. The chest x-ray findings along with the patient's smoking history are also indicative of lung cancer.

*2* The second most plausible answer is Pneumonia. While Pneumonia may present with cough, weight loss, and fatigue, the chronicity of the symptoms and the low sodium levels are less commonly associated with this condition. However, pneumonia can cause abnormal findings on a chest x-ray.

*3* The third most plausible answer is Tuberculosis. Tuberculosis can present with a chronic cough, weight loss, and fatigue. It is also associated with abnormal chest x-ray findings. However, the low sodium levels and the patient's smoking history make lung cancer a more likely diagnosis in this case.",Small cell lung carcinoma,Accurate
43,"Yo, so this 7-year-old dude showed up at the ER with sudden belly pain that started an hour ago. He had a UTI a few days back and got treated with nitrofurantoin for that. His parents are from Kenya, but he was born here. The exam shows his belly is tender, his spleen is a bit big, and his eyes are yellow. Lab results are:
- Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL
- Mean corpuscular volume: 88 μm3
- Reticulocyte count: 3.1%
- Serum Bilirubin: Total 3.8 mg/dL, Direct 0.6 mg/dL
- Haptoglobin: 16 mg/dL
- Lactate dehydrogenase: 179 U/L
What's the most likely reason for all this stuff going on with him?","1. Hemolytic anemia, likely from G6PD deficiency: The combination of low hemoglobin, elevated reticulocyte count, elevated indirect bilirubin, low haptoglobin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase point towards hemolysis. The fact that the child recently took nitrofurantoin also suggests the possibility of drug-induced hemolysis, especially in the context of his splenomegaly. Given the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in individuals of African descent, this diagnosis is highly plausible in this case.

2. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA): AIHA is another possible cause of hemolysis in this patient, especially given the splenomegaly and jaundice. However, the recent UTI treated with nitrofurantoin makes drug-induced hemolysis a more likely cause, particularly in the absence of other autoimmune symptoms and history.

3. Hereditary spherocytosis: Although hereditary spherocytosis can present with hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, and jaundice, the acute onset of symptoms in this case following nitrofurantoin treatment and the association with G6PD deficiency make it less likely than the other possibilities.",Enzyme deficiency in red blood cells,Relevant
44,"Dude, this 44-year-old guy just got wrecked in a crazy car crash and now has a bunch of injuries. They found he's got low sodium in his blood. Why do you think that is?","*1* The most likely reason for low sodium in a patient who has experienced a traumatic injury like a car crash is Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH). This condition is characterized by the excessive release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) leading to retention of water and dilution of sodium levels in the blood.

*2* Another possible cause of low sodium in this patient could be fluid overload due to administration of intravenous fluids in the initial management of trauma. Excessive administration of hypotonic fluids can cause dilutional hyponatremia.

*3* Additionally, stress-induced adrenal insufficiency could also be a contributing factor to low sodium levels post-injury. The trauma and stress associated with a car crash can lead to decreased production of hormones like aldosterone, which is responsible for maintaining electrolyte balance.",Physiologic ADH (vasopressin) secretion,Relevant
45,"Yo, so this 32-year-old sis rolls into the clinic saying her pee's all frothy and she's blowing up like a balloon since 4 days ago. She first noticed the puffiness in her face and now it's spreading everywhere. Her pee looks normal and she's still going the same amount. She's HIV+ and on meds like abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine. Vital signs look stable and she's got that pitting edema. Here are her urine test results:
pH 6.6
Color light yellow
RBC none
WBC 1–2/HPF
Protein 4+
Fat globules
No glucose, crystals, or ketones
No nitrites
24-hour urine protein: 5.2 g
A kidney biopsy shows what's in the pic. What's the likely diagnosis for this chick?","1. Nephrotic syndrome, likely due to HIV-associated nephropathy - The patient's presentation of frothy urine, generalized edema, heavy proteinuria (4+), and the presence of fat globules in the urine are classic features of nephrotic syndrome. Given the patient is HIV-positive and her kidney biopsy shows findings consistent with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), this is the most likely diagnosis.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) - While AKI can present with edema, the heavy proteinuria and lipiduria seen in this patient are more suggestive of nephrotic syndrome rather than AKI.

3. Drug-induced kidney injury - While it's important to consider medication-induced renal toxicity in patients with new symptoms, the pattern of proteinuria with lipiduria and the kidney biopsy findings make nephrotic syndrome and HIV-associated nephropathy more likely in this case.",Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,Relevant
46,"Yo, so this dude who's 62 rolled up to the doc's crib 'cause he's been bruising easily and getting nosebleeds on the reg for the past 4 months. Homie also says he's been feeling hella weak and dropped 22 pounds recently. The doc peeped him and saw he's looking pale as a ghost with bruises all over his arms and legs at different stages of healing. The doc felt his spleen about 4 cm below the left rib. Test results show he's anemic and got low platelet count. If you check out a pic of his blood under a microscope, what's the most likely finding when you look at a piece of his bone marrow?","1. *Aplastic anemia*: Aplastic anemia is characterized by pancytopenia, which is a reduction in all circulating blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). The low platelet count and anemia in this patient, along with the physical exam findings of bruising and splenomegaly, point towards aplastic anemia. Examination of his bone marrow would likely reveal hypocellular marrow with fatty infiltration.

2. *Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)*: Myelodysplastic syndrome is a group of disorders characterized by inefficient production of blood cells. Patients with MDS can present with anemia and low platelet count, similar to aplastic anemia. Bone marrow examination in MDS typically shows abnormal cell morphology and dysplasia.

3. *Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)*: Acute myeloid leukemia is a type of blood cancer that leads to the overproduction of immature white blood cells. While AML usually presents with symptoms like fatigue, fever, and frequent infections, the findings of anemia, low platelet count, and abnormal bone marrow could also be seen in this condition.",Neoplastic lymphocytes that stain positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase,Inaccurate
47,"Yo, this dude in his 30s is complaining about his right hand feeling weak. He's been biking like crazy since he was 20. He swears he hasn't had any recent accidents. The doc checked him out and found reduced feels in his pinky and ring finger, plus trouble straightening them out. His right hand and wrist muscles are only at a 4 out of 5 in strength. When he tries to stretch his fingers, the pic shows what happens. Which nerve do you think got messed up here?","*1* The most likely nerve that got messed up here is the ulnar nerve. It runs down from the shoulder to the hand and can be compressed or irritated at different points along its pathway, causing the symptoms described by the patient. The reduced sensation and weakness in the pinky and ring finger, as well as difficulty straightening them out, are classic signs of ulnar nerve compression.

*2* Another possible nerve that could be affected is the median nerve, but this is less likely given the specific symptoms presented by the patient. The median nerve primarily supplies sensation to the thumb, index, middle finger, and half of the ring finger, and is more commonly associated with carpal tunnel syndrome.

*3* The radial nerve is less likely to be the culprit in this scenario since it mainly innervates the extensor muscles of the forearm, wrist, and fingers. The symptoms described by the patient, such as reduced feels in the pinky and ring finger and trouble straightening them out, are not typically associated with radial nerve dysfunction.",Ulnar nerve,Accurate
48,"Yo, so like, if this kid has muscle weakness, pain, throwing up, seizures, a wicked bad headache, and only one side of his bod is kinda weak, and his muscle biopsy shows 'ragged red fibers,' what's the deal with how this disease gets passed down?","1. This disease is likely mitochondrial myopathy, which can be caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited solely from the mother, which means the disease is passed down maternally.

2. Another possible diagnosis could be MELAS syndrome (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes). This is also a mitochondrial disorder caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA.

3. Given the symptoms described and the presence of ""ragged red fibers"" in the muscle biopsy, a differential diagnosis could include Kearns-Sayre syndrome, which is another mitochondrial disorder.",It is transmitted only through the mother.,Accurate
49,"Yo, so this 11-year-old dude has been dealing with muscle cramps and feeling hella tired for the past year.

Plus, he's constantly needing to pee, which sucks 'cause he has to ask to go during class. The lab results show he's got low potassium, low chloride, metabolic alkalosis, low magnesium, and low calcium in his pee. The main culprit in his symptoms binds to which type of drug?","*1* 1. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
*2* 2. Loop diuretics
