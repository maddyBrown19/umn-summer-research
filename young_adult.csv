0,Why is this dude's ball sack getting bigger and glowing when you shine a light through it?,"1. The individual may have a hydrocele, which is a buildup of fluid around the testicle, causing the scrotum to enlarge. The fluid may appear to glow when a light is shined through it due to the transparency of the fluid.

2. Another possibility could be a scrotal hernia, where a part of the abdominal contents protrudes into the scrotum, causing it to enlarge. The hernia sac may appear to glow when a light is shined through it.

3. In rare cases, the glowing effect could be due to a rare condition known as scrotal calcinosis, where there are small calcified nodules present in the scrotum that may reflect light in a way that appears to make the scrotum glow.",Decreased lymphatic fluid absorption,Relevant
1,"Yo, this 27-year-old mama just had a C-section 'cause her baby was breech. Now, she's three days post-op and feeling some funky stuff - like lots of bleeding, gross discharge, and it hurts when she pees. Plus, she had a bout of kidney infection during pregnancy. Her temp is a bit high, pulse is up, and she's all clammy. Her lady parts are looking pretty nasty too. What's the move to help her out, fam?","1. Possible pelvic infection (endometritis) post C-section: This woman is displaying symptoms that could suggest an infection following her recent C-section, such as heavy bleeding, foul-smelling discharge, pain with urination, elevated temperature and pulse, and general discomfort. Given her history of a kidney infection during pregnancy, she may be at higher risk for developing this complication. Prompt medical attention is crucial to prevent further complications.

2. Urinary tract infection (UTI) or kidney infection (pyelonephritis): The symptoms of pain with urination and a history of kidney infection during pregnancy could point towards a UTI or pyelonephritis. These conditions require medical treatment, especially postoperatively to prevent any serious complications.

3. Wound infection following C-section: The presence of foul-smelling discharge, pain, and inflammation around her C-section incision site could indicate a wound infection. This needs to be evaluated by a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate treatment, such as antibiotics or wound care.",Clindamycin and gentamicin,Relevant
2,Why did the dude pass out while helping his girlfriend move furniture and why does he keep feeling dizzy at the gym?,"*1* Dehydration: Both passing out while helping with heavy lifting and feeling dizzy at the gym can be symptoms of dehydration. Strenuous activities like moving furniture and working out at the gym can lead to fluid loss through sweating, and inadequate water intake can result in dehydration, causing symptoms like lightheadedness and fainting.

*2* Low blood sugar: Low blood sugar levels, also known as hypoglycemia, can cause dizziness, weakness, and fainting. Engaging in physical activities like moving heavy objects or working out at the gym can lead to a drop in blood sugar levels, especially if the person hasn't eaten properly beforehand.

*3* Overexertion: The combination of helping with heavy lifting and pushing oneself too hard at the gym could lead to overexertion. Overexertion can result in fatigue, muscle weakness, dizziness, and fainting as the body struggles to keep up with the demands being placed on it. It is important to listen to the body's signals and not overextend oneself during physical activities.",Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Relevant
3,"Yo, so this 27-year-old chick is preggo and keeps having seizures. She used to take valproic acid for her seizures but stopped when she got knocked up. She isn't into meds, more of a shaman type of gal. She's down with starting carbamazepine now. What's the best move for her treatment right now?","*1* The best move for the pregnant woman experiencing seizures who used to take valproic acid but is now switching to carbamazepine is to consult with a neurologist or epileptologist to discuss the risks and benefits of the new treatment plan. It is important to have a medical professional guide the process to ensure the best outcome for the mother and the fetus.

*2* It is recommended for the pregnant woman to follow up with regular prenatal care appointments to monitor both her health and the health of the baby during the pregnancy. This will provide an opportunity to discuss any side effects or concerns related to the new medication and optimize the treatment plan accordingly.

*3* The pregnant woman should also be encouraged to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and adequate rest to support her overall well-being during this critical time. Stress management techniques such as mindfulness, yoga, or meditation may also be beneficial in reducing the risk of seizures.",Folate,Inaccurate.
4,"Yo, a 45-year-old lady who goes to the doc for a checkup is feeling good, living the single life and banking it. She smokes one cig a day and throws back 2 drinks each night. Sometimes she gets funky hand pain with color changes. Her vitals are normal except her blood pressure is high. She's on meds for hypertension but coming back cuz she's packing on weight in her legs and arms with some swelling. What should we do next?","*1* The most plausible answer is that the lady is experiencing symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is a circulatory condition that causes narrowing of the blood vessels and reduced blood flow to the extremities. This can result in symptoms like hand pain with color changes, swelling, and weight gain in the affected limbs.

*2* The second plausible answer is that the lady may also be exhibiting symptoms of heart failure, which can cause fluid accumulation in the legs and arms due to the heart's inability to effectively pump blood throughout the body. This can be exacerbated by her hypertension and lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption.

*3* The third plausible answer is that the lady's symptoms may also be indicative of a liver disorder, such as alcoholic liver disease, which can result from the combination of her alcohol consumption and smoking habits. Liver dysfunction can lead to fluid retention and weight gain in the arms and legs, as well as other systemic issues.",Lisinopril,Inaccurate.
5,"Yo, so like, why is tadalafil gonna help this dude with his breathing probs and heart stuff?","1. Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor commonly used to treat erectile dysfunction. PDE5 is also found in the smooth muscle of the lungs and blood vessels, which can help dilate these vessels and improve blood flow. 
2. The improved blood flow to the lungs can help in conditions like pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to breathing difficulties and heart problems. 
3. Tadalafil may also improve exercise capacity and symptoms in individuals with pulmonary arterial hypertension, a condition where high blood pressure affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart.",Enhanced activity of nitric oxide,Relevant

10,"Hey, so a 33-year-old chick has been dealing with bellyaches, diarrhea, feeling bloated, nausea, and losing about 11 pounds in 4 months. She also feels like she can't fully poop and has this weird family background. Her dad's an Ashkenazi Jew. She's got normal vitals and the doc finds some stuff in her right lower belly. The tests show some inflammation and blockage in her right colon. What's probably going on with her?","1. *1* Crohn's Disease: The symptoms described, along with the family history of being Ashkenazi Jewish and the presence of inflammation and blockage in the colon, are highly indicative of Crohn's Disease, a chronic inflammatory condition that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. This is the most likely diagnosis given the symptoms and findings.
2. *2* Colorectal Cancer: Given the symptoms and the presence of a blockage in the right colon, colorectal cancer is a serious concern that cannot be ruled out. This possibility should be thoroughly investigated and evaluated further.
3. *3* Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): While IBS can present with symptoms similar to those described, the presence of inflammation and blockage in the colon makes it a less likely explanation compared to more serious conditions like Crohn's Disease or colorectal cancer in this case.",Crohn disease,Relevant.
11,"Yo, so like, what's the best move for feeding this dude who just had surgery for a head bleed after falling off a 2-story building and is now chillin' in the ICU on a vent?","*1* The best move would be to consult with the medical team taking care of the patient to determine the appropriate feeding plan for someone in the ICU with a head injury. The medical team can assess the patient's condition, evaluate their nutritional needs, and recommend the best course of action for feeding to optimize their recovery.

*2* In general, a patient in the ICU with a head injury may require enteral nutrition (feeding through a tube) to ensure they receive the necessary nutrients for healing. The medical team may recommend starting with a clear liquid diet and gradually advancing to more solid foods as the patient tolerates. It's important to follow the guidance of the medical team to prevent complications and support the patient's recovery.

*3* It's important to avoid feeding the patient orally while they are on a ventilator in the ICU to reduce the risk of aspiration (food or liquid entering the lungs).

12,"Yo, so like this little dude with delays goes to the doc 'cause he's got this super itchy rash on his elbows, knees, and eyelids. His mom says it's been on and off since he was a baby. Everything looks good with his vitals. The kid's skin and hair are light and there's this funky smell in his sweat and pee. What should he eat, considering all this?","*1* This child may have a condition called ""Kaplan plasicka syndrome,"" an inherited metabolic disorder characterized by a deficiency of cystathionine γ-synthase enzyme, leading to an accumulation of homocysteine and methionine. To manage this condition, the child should follow a low-methionine diet and avoid foods high in methionine such as meat, nuts, and dairy products. Increasing intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can be beneficial.

*2* Another consideration could be the child having a rare metabolic disorder known as maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). In MSUD, the body is unable to break down certain amino acids, leading to the accumulation of toxic substances in the blood and urine. Therefore, the child should follow a low-protein diet, avoiding protein-rich foods like meat, eggs, and dairy while favoring carbohydrates and fats for energy.

*3* Lastly, given the symptoms described, there could also be an underlying issue with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease. In this case, a gluten-free diet would be recommended to alleviate symptoms of the rash and gastrointestinal issues that may be present. The child should avoid gluten-containing foods such as wheat, barley, and rye, while opting for gluten-free alternatives like rice, quinoa, and corn.",Avoid meat,Relevant
13,"Yo, so like, this dude in his 70s is at the clinic for a check-up, he's been dealing with high blood pressure for like forever and takes a bunch of meds. His BP is 150/100 mm Hg and everything else looks normal, but the echocardiogram showed some left ventricle changes. What's causing this, bro?","1. The most likely cause of left ventricle changes in a patient with long-standing high blood pressure is left ventricular hypertrophy. This occurs when the left ventricle has to work harder to pump blood against the increased pressure in the arteries, leading to thickening of the heart muscle.

2. Another possible cause of left ventricle changes in the setting of high blood pressure is diastolic dysfunction. This occurs when the heart muscle becomes stiff and less compliant, impairing its ability to relax and fill with blood properly during the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle.

3. Lastly, a less common cause of left ventricle changes in this patient could be myocardial ischemia, which can occur due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle as a result of the increased workload from high blood pressure. This can lead to changes in the structure and function of the left ventricle.",Increase in cardiac cell size,Relevant

He's clean though, never smoked or drank alcohol/caffeine before bed. Docs talked to him about sleep hygiene, but what's the next move here?","*1* One possible reason for his trouble sleeping and feeling tired in the mornings could be obstructive sleep apnea. This condition is characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep, leading to disrupted sleep and daytime fatigue. Given his risk factors such as high blood pressure and potential obesity due to age and lack of smoking/alcohol use, sleep apnea could be a likely culprit.

*2* Another possibility could be restless legs syndrome (RLS), a neurological disorder characterized by an urge to move the legs, often worsened at night. This condition can significantly disrupt sleep and lead to daytime tiredness. RLS is more common in individuals with certain medical conditions like high blood pressure and can present at any age.

*3* In addition, it's important to consider that the prostate issues may be impacting his ability to get quality sleep. If he is experiencing symptoms such as frequent urination during the night or discomfort that disrupts sleep, this could be contributing to his sleep disturbances and tiredness in the mornings. It may be helpful for him to discuss this aspect with his healthcare provider for further evaluation and management.",Zolpidem,Inaccurate.
22,"Yo, what class does that antibiotic belong to that makes those bacteria swell up and burst like that after being treated in hypotonic saline?","1. **Beta-lactam antibiotics:** Beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, work by inhibiting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, leading to weakened cell walls that are vulnerable to bursts when placed in a hypotonic environment.
2. **Glycopeptide antibiotics:** Glycopeptide antibiotics, such as vancomycin, also target the bacterial cell wall and can lead to cell lysis in hypotonic conditions, although they are not as commonly associated with this mechanism as beta-lactams.
3. **Polymyxin antibiotics:** Polymyxin antibiotics, like polymyxin B, can disrupt the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane, potentially leading to lysis in a hypotonic environment.",Cephalosporin,Relevant

Her vital signs seem mostly okay, but some lab results are a bit off. Can you guess what might be going on here?","1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) could be a likely cause of the baby's symptoms since she is fussy, throwing up, and having feeding difficulties. This condition is common in infants and can cause discomfort after feeding.

2. Failure to thrive could be another possibility, as the baby is on the shorter and lighter side which may indicate inadequate weight gain and growth.

3. Pyloric stenosis could also be a consideration, especially if the baby is projectile vomiting. This condition involves a narrowing of the opening from the stomach to the small intestine, leading to persistent vomiting and poor feeding.",Inability of the distal tubule to secrete H+,Inaccurate.
27,"Hey, so a 29-year-old new mom has been dealing with no period, can't breastfeed, hella tired since baby came, suddenly feels freezing all the time (weird, she was fine before), and gained 5 pounds post-birth. Her delivery had some heavy bleeding and low blood pressure. What hormone level might actually be normal in her case?","1. Prolactin level: This new mom's inability to breastfeed and lack of menstruation point towards a potential issue with prolactin levels after delivery, given it's crucial for lactation. However, since her prolactin levels may still be normal, as indicated by her inability to breastfeed, this suggests that prolactin is not the key hormone causing her symptoms.

2. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level: The new mom's symptoms of feeling freezing all the time, unexplained weight gain, extreme fatigue, and irregular menstruation could indicate hypothyroidism, where the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. Given her symptoms, it is plausible that her TSH level could be normal, as this hormone may not be the root cause of her issues.

3. Cortisol level: The combination of extreme fatigue, weight gain, and other vague symptoms could potentially point towards adrenal insufficiency, a condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol. However, since her symptoms are non-specific and may not align perfectly with adrenal insufficiency, it is less likely that her cortisol level is the primary hormone causing her issues.",Aldosterone,Relevant

3. Acute pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms of upper abdominal pain, sweating, and a soft belly could be indicative of acute pancreatitis. This condition should be considered and evaluated further, especially given her medical history and medications that could contribute to pancreatitis.",Esophagogastroduodenoscopy,Relevant
37,"Dude, why does this guy's toe, hips, and knees hurt when he walks but feel better when he chills? 🚶‍♂️💊","1. The most plausible answer is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a joint disease that affects the cartilage in joints, leading to pain and stiffness, especially with movement. Symptoms can worsen with activity and improve with rest.

2. Another possible answer is rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation in the joints, leading to pain and swelling. Symptoms are often worse with movement and can improve with rest.

3. Additionally, gout could be causing the symptoms. Gout is a form of arthritis that occurs when uric acid crystals build up in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain. Symptoms may be triggered by certain activities and improve with rest.",Osteoarthritis,Relevant
38,"Yo, so like, what's the best way to treat this dude's elbow situation?","*1* The best way to treat an elbow injury would be to follow the R.I.C.E. protocol, which stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. Rest the affected elbow, apply ice to reduce swelling and pain, use compression bandages to provide extra support, and elevate the elbow above heart level to reduce swelling.

*2* Physical therapy may also be beneficial in treating the elbow injury. A physical therapist can provide exercises to strengthen the muscles surrounding the elbow, improve flexibility, and promote healing.

*3* If the pain and swelling persist, it would be recommended to consult with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and potential imaging studies such as x-rays or MRI to assess for any serious underlying injury like a fracture or ligament tear. A healthcare provider may also prescribe pain medication or recommend other treatment options based on the specific diagnosis.",Calcipotriene,Inaccurate
39,"Dude, this guy fell hard and is in bad shape at the ER. His pulse is racing, breathing is fast, and blood pressure is super low. They found a wound on his left side and his left lung ain't sounding right. What's the most likely issue here?","*1* This patient is likely experiencing a tension pneumothorax, which occurs when air escapes from the lung into the chest cavity and cannot escape. This leads to a build-up of pressure, causing compression and collapse of the affected lung, leading to the symptoms described - rapid pulse, fast breathing, low blood pressure, and abnormal lung sounds.

*2* Another possibility could be hemorrhagic shock, where severe bleeding leads to a decrease in blood volume and therefore low blood pressure. However, the presence of a wound on the left side and abnormal lung sounds make tension pneumothorax a more likely cause in this case.

*3* Cardiac tamponade could also be considered as a differential diagnosis, which occurs when fluid builds up in the pericardium (the sac around the heart), causing compression of the heart and leading to symptoms like low blood pressure. However, given the presence of a left-sided wound and abnormal lung sounds, tension pneumothorax is a more likely scenario.",Hemothorax,Relevant.
40,"Why does a 68-year-old woman, who just had heart catheterization for a heart attack and has high blood pressure and high cholesterol, suddenly have painful and discolored toes? What could she be at risk for now?","*1* This woman could be experiencing symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PAD) due to atherosclerosis in her lower extremities, causing her toes to become painful and discolored.
*2* Another potential cause could be a blood clot in the arteries leading to her toes, known as peripheral arterial thrombosis.
*3* Additionally, she may be at risk for peripheral neuropathy, which can cause pain and changes in skin color in the toes due to damaged nerves in the legs and feet.",Acute kidney injury,Relevant
41,"Yo, so like, this chick with a bunch of health issues is coming in with burning when she pees a lot and having to go all the time. She never had a UTI before, but her mom stays getting them often. She's got diabetes, high blood pressure, cervical cancer, and high cholesterol. She smokes a pack a day and gets a glass of wine in, but no drugs. Her body temp is normal, blood pressure is chill, heart rate and breathing are good. When we check her out, her lungs sound fine, but she's got a heart murmur and pain up top of her privates. Urine test shows lots of white blood cells, white blood cell enzyme, and nitrites. Can you tell me which of these things wouldn't make a UTI complicated?","1. Pregnancy - Pregnancy can increase the risk of UTIs, but it does not necessarily complicate the condition in the same way as other underlying health issues or conditions.

2. Diabetes - Individuals with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing UTIs. Diabetes can complicate the treatment and management of UTIs due to impaired immune function and poor blood sugar control.

3. High cholesterol - High cholesterol is not directly related to the development or complications of a UTI. It may not impact the diagnosis or management of a UTI in the same way as diabetes or other health issues.",The causative organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Inaccurate
42,"Yo, so this dude is 58 and just had a big seizure. His wife says he's been hacking up a lung for months, plus he's tired all the time and dropped some serious weight. He's a long-time smoker, too. Now he's all confused at the hospital. They found low sodium in his blood and a weird spot on his lung x-ray. What's the likely diagnosis when they check out that spot under a microscope?","*1* - Small cell lung carcinoma  
*2* - Metastatic lung cancer  
*3* - Pulmonary tuberculosis",Small cell lung carcinoma,Accurate
43,"Yo, dude, you're 7 years old and suddenly got stomach pain which started an hour ago. You recently had a UTI and got treated with nitrofurantoin. Your parents are from Kenya, and you got some abdominal tenderness, mild splenomegaly, and yellow eyes. Your lab results show low hemoglobin, high MCV, high bilirubin, low haptoglobin, and high LDH. What's the most likely reason for all this craziness in your bod?","1. Sickle cell disease crisis
2. G6PD deficiency crisis
3. Hemolytic anemia crisis",Enzyme deficiency in red blood cells,Relevant
44,"Yo, what's the deal with the low sodium levels in this dude after the car crash?","*1* This individual may have low sodium levels due to fluid loss from trauma-related injuries sustained during the car crash. A common cause of low sodium levels is hypovolemic hyponatremia, which occurs when there is a decrease in blood volume due to fluid loss.
*2* Another possible cause of low sodium levels could be the administration of intravenous (IV) fluids with a low sodium concentration in the pre-hospital or hospital setting. IV fluids with a lower sodium content can dilute the sodium levels in the blood, leading to hyponatremia.
*3* Additionally, the individual may have developed syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion in response to the stress of the car crash. SIADH can cause the body to retain water, leading to a dilutional effect on sodium levels.",Physiologic ADH (vasopressin) secretion,Relevant
45,"Dude, is this chick suffering from nephrotic syndrome or what?! 🤔🤒","*1* Nephrotic syndrome is a kidney disorder that causes your body to excrete too much protein in your urine. Common symptoms include swelling, especially around the eyes and in the legs, and foamy urine. A definitive diagnosis would require specific laboratory testing to measure protein levels in the urine and blood, as well as a kidney biopsy to confirm the underlying cause. 
*2* Other possible causes of swelling, proteinuria, and fatigue should also be considered, such as heart failure, liver disease, or certain medications. It's important for the individual to see a healthcare provider for proper evaluation and diagnosis. 
*3* Nephrotic syndrome is commonly seen in children, but can also occur in adults. Treatment may involve medications to control blood pressure, reduce proteinuria, and manage cholesterol levels. Consulting a healthcare provider is crucial for appropriate management.",Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,Relevant.
46,"Yo, bro, so this dude in his 60s is going to the doc 'cause he keeps getting bruises easily and nosebleeds on the reg for the past 4 months. On top of that, he's been feelin' hella weak and lost like 22 pounds. Doc sees his mucosa lookin' pale AF and bruises all over his arms and legs that are healing. His spleen is kinda big, sittin' 4 cm below the left rib. Lab tests show he's anemic and his platelet count is low. What's the deal with his bone marrow? What's it likely gonna show?","1. Aplastic anemia - Bone marrow biopsy would likely show hypocellular marrow with fatty infiltration. This can lead to pancytopenia (low counts of all blood cell types) including anemia and low platelets.
2. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) - Bone marrow biopsy may show abnormal cells and dysplastic changes in the marrow leading to cytopenias like anemia and low platelets.
3. Acute Leukemia - Bone marrow biopsy may show increased blast cells. Acute leukemias can present with symptoms like easy bruising, nosebleeds, weight loss, weakness, and an enlarged spleen.",Neoplastic lymphocytes that stain positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase,Inaccurate.
47,"Yo, this 30-year-old dude who loves biking has been feeling weak in his right hand lately. No recent accidents though. Doc found decreased sensations in his pinky and ring finger, and he's having trouble straightening those fingers out. His right hand and wrist muscles are only at 4 out of 5 strength. When he tries to extend his fingers, the pic shows the result. So, what nerve do you think is messed up here?","*1* The most likely nerve that is affected in this case is the Ulnar nerve. The symptoms of weakness in the right hand, decreased sensations in the pinky and ring finger, and difficulty straightening out those fingers are all indicative of Ulnar nerve dysfunction.

*2* Another possible nerve that could be affected is the Median nerve. However, in this case, the symptoms more closely align with those associated with Ulnar nerve dysfunction.

*3* The Radial nerve is another potential nerve that could be affected, but given the specific symptoms described and the distribution of weakness and sensory deficits, Ulnar nerve compression or entrapment is the most likely cause.",Ulnar nerve,Accurate
48,"Is this disease, like, passed down in families or does it just happen randomly?","*1* The disease is genetic and can be passed down from parents to children.
*2* The disease can also occur spontaneously, due to random genetic mutations.
*3* Environmental factors may also play a role in the development of the disease.",It is transmitted only through the mother.,relevant
49,"Yo, why does this kid keep getting muscle cramps, feeling tired all the time, and needing to pee constantly? His mom's saying it's been going on for a while, but it's gotten way worse since he started middle school. The doc ran some tests and found low potassium, chloride, magnesium, and calcium in his blood, along with a weird type of acid-base imbalance. Now they're asking about a protein that binds to certain meds - what's the deal with that?","*1* The most plausible explanation for the symptoms described is **Bartter syndrome**, a rare genetic disorder characterized by a specific acid-base imbalance and electrolyte abnormalities that include low potassium, chloride, magnesium, and calcium levels in the blood. Bartter syndrome can present with muscle cramps, fatigue, and increased urination. The mention of a protein that binds to certain medications likely refers to the gene mutations associated with Bartter syndrome that can affect drug metabolism.

*2* Another possibility is **Gitelman syndrome**, another rare genetic disorder that shares similarities with Bartter syndrome. Gitelman syndrome is characterized by low potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels in the blood, leading to symptoms such as muscle cramps, fatigue, and increased urinary frequency. It also presents with an acid-base imbalance, similar to Bartter syndrome.

*3* Lastly, an autoimmune disorder known as **Sjögren's syndrome** can also lead to electrolyte imbalances, fatigue, muscle cramps, and increased urination. Sjögren's syndrome can affect the exocrine glands, leading to decreased production of tears and saliva, as well as electrolyte abnormalities that may manifest with the symptoms described.",Hydrochlorothiazide,Relevant
