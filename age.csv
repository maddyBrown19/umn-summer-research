0,"A man is brought to the emergency department with sudden onset lower limb paralysis and back pain. He has had generalized bone pain for 2 months. He has no history of severe illnesses. He takes ibuprofen for pain. On examination, he is pale. The vital signs include: temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse 68/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and blood pressure 155/90 mm Hg. The neurologic examination shows paraparesis. The 8th thoracic vertebra is tender to palpation. An X-ray of the thoracic vertebrae confirms a compression fracture at the same level. The laboratory studies show the following:
Laboratory test
Hemoglobin 9 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 95 μm3
Leukocyte count 5,000/mm3
Platelet count 240,000/mm3
ESR 85 mm/hour
Serum
Na+ 135 mEq/L
K+ 4.2 mEq/L
Cl− 113 mEq/L
HCO3− 20 mEq/L
Ca+ 11.5 mg/dL
Albumin 4 g/dL
Urea nitrogen 18 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Serum electrophoresis shows a monoclonal protein level of 38 g/L. To reduce the likelihood of fracture recurrence, it is most appropriate to administer which of the following?","1. **Bisphosphonates**: These drugs inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, which can help to stabilize the bone and reduce the risk of further fractures. Bisphosphonates are commonly used in conditions with increased bone turnover, such as multiple myeloma, which appears likely given the presence of monoclonal protein and hypercalcemia.

2. **Corticosteroids**: In cases of multiple myeloma, corticosteroids such as dexamethasone can reduce bone pain and inflammation, and they are often part of the treatment regimen. Though they don’t directly prevent fractures, they can be part of a broader disease management approach which may include adjunctive therapies to slow disease progression.

3. **Physical therapy and supportive bracing**: While not a medication, establishing a regimen of physical therapy and using supportive bracing can help strengthen muscles around the spine and provide additional support to reduce the risk of further vertebral compression fractures. This should be used alongside pharmacologic interventions.",Pamidronate,accurate
1,"A male accountant presents to the family practice clinic for his first health check-up in years. He has no complaints and considers himself to be well. He does not have any known medical conditions. Regarding family history, the patient reports that his wife's brother died of a heart attack at 35 years of age. His blood pressure is 140/89 mm Hg and his heart rate is 89/min. The physical examination is otherwise unremarkable. What is the single best initial management for this patient?","1. Lifestyle Modifications: Given the patient's blood pressure of 140/89 mm Hg, which is classified as stage 1 hypertension, the first step in management should be recommending lifestyle changes. This includes dietary modifications such as reducing salt intake, adopting the DASH diet, increasing physical activity, reducing alcohol consumption, and weight loss if the patient is overweight.

2. Repeat Blood Pressure Measurements: To confirm the diagnosis of hypertension, it's advisable to have the patient monitor his blood pressure at home or return for repeated measurements over several weeks. This helps to rule out white-coat hypertension and ensures an accurate diagnosis.

3. Basic Laboratory Tests: Ordering basic laboratory tests, including a lipid profile, fasting glucose, and electrolytes, could provide additional information about the patient's cardiovascular risk and help guide further management if needed.",Return to the clinic for a repeat blood pressure reading and counseling on the importance of aerobic exercise.,relevant
2,"A man presents to the emergency department with leg pain. He states that the pain started suddenly while he was walking outside. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and atrial fibrillation. His temperature is 99.3°F (37.4°C), blood pressure is 152/98 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a cold and pale left leg. The patient’s sensation is markedly diminished in the left leg when compared to the right, and his muscle strength is 1/5 in his left leg. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","1. **Initiate emergency anticoagulation and arrange for urgent vascular surgery consultation**: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the acute presentation of cold, pale leg with diminished sensation and muscle strength, there is a high suspicion for acute limb ischemia due to arterial embolism. Immediate anticoagulation (e.g., intravenous heparin) can prevent further thrombus formation and progression of ischemia, and an urgent vascular surgery consult is necessary for potential revascularization.
   
2. **Order an arterial Doppler ultrasound of the left leg**: This imaging study can help confirm the diagnosis of acute arterial occlusion by assessing blood flow in the affected limb. Although it is essential, it should be done promptly and while concurrently preparing for possible intervention.
   
3. **Administer analgesics for pain management**: Providing pain relief is important for patient comfort, especially in acute settings. However, this step should not delay definitive management for the underlying cause of the symptoms, which is presumed to be vascular in nature here.",Heparin drip,Accurate
3,"A woman is brought to the physician by her daughter because of a 3-day history of a runny nose, headache, and cough. The patient's grandson recently had similar symptoms. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 99%. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Testing of nasal secretions is performed to identify the viral strain. Electron microscopy shows a non-enveloped RNA virus with an icosahedral capsid. Binding to which of the following is responsible for the virulence of this virus?","1. *Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1):* The most plausible answer is ICAM-1, as the described virus is indicative of the Rhinovirus, which is a non-enveloped RNA virus with an icosahedral capsid. Rhinoviruses bind to ICAM-1 receptors on respiratory epithelial cells, leading to the common cold symptoms described.

2. *CD155 (Poliovirus Receptor):* While not as likely given the context and symptoms, Poliovirus is another non-enveloped RNA virus with an icosahedral capsid. It binds to the CD155 receptor, but the clinical presentation does not typically involve the common cold symptoms noted here.

3. *CD81 (Tetraspanin, Hepatitis C Virus Receptor):* Though Hepatitis C virus also has an RNA genome, it is an enveloped virus rather than non-enveloped. However, it binds to CD81 receptors. This is less plausible due to the discrepancy in virus structure and typical clinical presentation.",ICAM-1,accurate
4,"A boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of a 2-day history of poor feeding and lethargy. He was born at term and has had three episodes of bilateral otitis media since birth. Umbilical cord separation occurred at the age of 8 weeks. He is at the 30th percentile for height and 20th percentile for weight. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F) and blood pressure is 58/36 mm Hg. Physical examination shows white oral patches and confluent scaly erythematous skin lesions in the groin. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 41,300/mm3 (92% segmented neutrophils and 8% lymphocytes) and a platelet count of 224,000/mm3. Blood cultures at 20°C (68°F) grow catalase-positive yeast cells that form pseudohyphae. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?","1. **Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)**: This is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by the inability of phagocytes to produce reactive oxygen species required to kill certain bacteria and fungi. The recurrent infections, poor feeding, lethargy, and the particular pathogens (catalase-positive organisms like yeast) are consistent with CGD.

2. **Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)**: Although SCID is typically associated with more severe infections and a broader range of pathogens, it can present with recurrent infections and failure to thrive. The severe lymphopenia can make the immune system ineffective against infections.

3. **Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD)**: This condition is characterized by delayed umbilical cord separation, recurrent bacterial infections, and high leukocyte counts due to an inability of white blood cells to migrate to sites of infection. Although primarily bacterial infections are typical, fungal infections can occur due to general immunodeficiency.",Defective beta-2 integrin,accurate
5,"A woman comes to the doctor because of gradually progressive weakness in her right hand over the past few weeks. She goes to the gym to lift weights 5 times a week. With the dorsum of the right hand on a flat surface, the patient is unable to move her thumb to touch a pen held 2 cm above the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. An MRI of the right arm shows compression of a nerve that passes through the pronator teres muscle. Based on the examination findings, loss of innervation of which of the following muscles is most likely in this patient?","1. **Abductor pollicis brevis** - This muscle is innervated by the median nerve, which passes through the pronator teres muscle. Compression of the median nerve would affect the abductor pollicis brevis, leading to difficulty in thumb abduction.

2. **Opponens pollicis** - This muscle is also innervated by the median nerve. Compression of the nerve could result in weakness or inability to oppose the thumb, which aligns with the patient's difficulty in thumb movement.

3. **Flexor pollicis longus** - While the primary function is thumb flexion, this muscle is innervated by the anterior interosseous nerve, a branch of the median nerve. Compression could cause weakness in thumb flexion, contributing to the overall impairment seen in thumb movement.",Abductor pollicis brevis,accurate
6,A couple expecting their first child present to the obstetrician for routine follow-up at 16 weeks gestation. The father suffers from Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and wants to know if it is possible that he has passed down the disease to his unborn daughter. The correct response is:,"1. No, it is unlikely. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is typically inherited through the mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down from the mother, not the father. Therefore, the father would not pass this condition to his child.

2. The risk is essentially zero. Since LHON is a mitochondrial disorder and only mitochondria from the mother's egg contribute to the embryo, paternal transmission of LHON does not occur.

3. Genetic counseling could help. Although the father cannot transmit LHON to the child, it may still be helpful for the couple to undergo genetic counseling to understand all genetic factors and risks associated with their pregnancy.","No, the father cannot pass the disease to any offpring.",accurate
7,A man comes to the physician with difficulty swallowing for several weeks. Examination of the oropharynx shows lesions on the palate and tongue that can be easily scraped off. An image of the lesions is shown. Which of the following is a risk factor for this patient's findings?,"1. **Immunosuppression**: Conditions like HIV/AIDS, cancer chemotherapy, or the use of immunosuppressive drugs can weaken the immune system, making the patient more susceptible to infections like oral candidiasis (thrush), which is characterized by easily scraped off white lesions.

2. **Diabetes Mellitus**: Poorly controlled diabetes can lead to hyperglycemia, which provides an ideal environment for yeast growth, including Candida species, leading to oral thrush.

3. **Prolonged use of antibiotics or corticosteroids**: These can disrupt the normal microbial flora of the mouth, allowing for overgrowth of Candida, resulting in lesions that are typical of oral candidiasis.",Decline in CD4+ T-cells,relevant
8,"A boy is brought to the physician because of increasing swelling of his legs and generalized fatigue for 1 month. During this period he has also had a productive cough and shortness of breath. He has been unable to carry out his daily activities. He has a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections and chronic nasal congestion since childhood. He has a 3-month history of foul-smelling and greasy stools. He is at 4th percentile for height and weight. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 23/min, and blood pressure is 104/64 mm Hg. Examination shows clubbing of his fingers and scoliosis. There is 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. Jugular venous distention is present. Inspiratory crackles are heard in the thorax. Cardiac examination shows a loud S2. The abdomen is mildly distended and the liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Hepato-jugular reflux is present. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","1. **Cystic Fibrosis**: The patient has several hallmark signs of cystic fibrosis, including chronic respiratory symptoms (productive cough, shortness of breath, recurrent respiratory infections), failure to thrive (4th percentile for height and weight), and gastrointestinal symptoms (foul-smelling, greasy stools). Clubbing of fingers, scoliosis, and findings associated with cor pulmonale (jugular venous distention, hepatomegaly, hepato-jugular reflux, and a loud S2) further support this diagnosis.

2. **Congenital Heart Disease (such as a ventricular septal defect with Eisenmenger syndrome)**: The presence of generalized fatigue, lower extremity edema, clubbing, and signs of right heart failure (jugular venous distention, hepato-jugular reflux) might suggest a congenital heart defect that has led to pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. However, this does not fully explain the chronic respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.

3. **Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia**: This condition can present with symptoms similar to those of cystic fibrosis including recurrent respiratory infections, chronic productive cough, and failure to thrive. However, it is less likely to cause severe gastrointestinal malabsorption (foul-smelling, greasy stools) compared to cystic fibrosis.",Cystic fibrosis,accurate
9,"A woman presents to her physician for difficulty breathing. She states that this typically happens to her when she goes outside and improves with rest and staying indoors. Her symptoms are currently worse than usual. The patient has never seen a physician before and has no diagnosed past medical history. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 97/58 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 25/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Pulmonary function tests demonstrate a decreased inspiratory and expiratory flow rate. Which of the following is the best initial treatment for this patient?","1. Inhaled Beta-2 Agonist (e.g., Albuterol) - This is commonly used as a bronchodilator in acute asthma exacerbations or other obstructive airway diseases. Given her symptoms improve indoors and worsen outside, asthma is a strong possibility, making this the best initial treatment to promptly relieve her symptoms.

2. Short Course of Oral Corticosteroids (e.g., Prednisone) - If the symptoms are severe or not adequately controlled with bronchodilators alone, a short course of corticosteroids can help reduce inflammation in the airways, providing more lasting relief.

3. Supplemental Oxygen - Given her oxygen saturation is 88% on room air, providing supplemental oxygen can help improve her immediate oxygenation status, which is critical for her overall stability and comfort.",Epinephrine,inaccurate
10,A woman comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of headache and worsening vision. Ophthalmologic examination shows a visual acuity of 20/120 in the right eye and 20/80 in the left eye. Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin of 14.2 g/dL and total serum calcium of 9.9 mg/dL. A photomicrograph of a peripheral blood smear is shown. Serum electrophoresis shows increased concentration of a pentameric immunoglobulin. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,"1. *Waldenström macroglobulinemia* - This condition is characterized by an overproduction of a type of monoclonal IgM antibody, which typically appears as a pentamer in serum electrophoresis. The clinical features include hyperviscosity syndrome, which can cause headaches and visual disturbances, fitting the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

2. *Meningioma* - Although not directly related to the blood smear or serum electrophoresis findings, this brain tumor can cause headaches and vision problems due to its pressure effects on nearby structures. However, it does not explain the serum electrophoresis findings.

3. *Hyperviscosity syndrome* - Often seen in conditions with elevated immunoglobulin levels, such as multiple myeloma or macroglobulinemia, this syndrome could explain the patient's headaches and visual disturbances. Serum electrophoresis indicating a pentameric immunoglobulin strongly suggests a condition like Waldenström macroglobulinemia, leading to increased blood viscosity.",Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia,accurate
11,"A man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of upper abdominal pain that occurs immediately after eating. The pain is sharp, localized to the epigastrium, and does not radiate. He reports that he has been eating less frequently to avoid the pain and has had a 4-kg (8.8-lb) weight loss during this time. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years and drinks 3 beers daily. His vital signs are within normal limits. He is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 76.6 kg (169 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2. Physical examination shows mild upper abdominal tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory studies are within the reference range. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following conditions?","1. **Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD):** Given the patient's symptoms of sharp, localized epigastric pain that occurs immediately after eating, a history of smoking, and alcohol consumption, peptic ulcer disease is the most likely diagnosis. These risk factors and the resulting pain pattern are characteristic of PUD.

2. **Gastritis:** The patient's habits of smoking and frequent alcohol consumption also predispose him to gastritis, which can present with upper abdominal pain, especially related to meals. Gastritis often presents with similar symptoms as PUD but is typically associated with more diffuse pain rather than the localized pain he describes.

3. **Gastric Cancer:** Although less common, the significant weight loss and pain associated with eating could also raise concern for gastric cancer, particularly in a patient with chronic irritants like smoking and alcohol use. However, given the more common nature of PUD and gastritis and the lack of more definitive signs of cancer (e.g., significant anemia, palpable mass), this is a less likely but still plausible diagnosis.",Gastrointestinal hemorrhage,Inaccurate
12,"A boy is brought to the clinic with a history of recurrent episodes of stridor and wheezing. His mother reports that the wheezing is exacerbated by crying, feeding, and flexion of the neck, and is relieved by extension of the neck. Occasionally he vomits after feeding. What is the most likely diagnosis?","1. Laryngomalacia
2. Tracheomalacia
3. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)",Double aortic arch,relevant
13,"A woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of worsening shortness of breath on exertion and fatigue. She has type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and chronic kidney disease. Her mother was diagnosed with colon cancer at the age of 65 years. Her blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. Examination shows conjunctival pallor. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 88 μm3
Reticulocyte count 0.6 %
Serum
Ferritin 145 ng/mL
Creatinine 3.1 mg/dL
Calcium 8.8 mg/dL
A fecal occult blood test is pending. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?","1. Anemia of chronic disease (also known as anemia of chronic inflammation) - This condition is commonly linked to chronic illnesses like diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and chronic kidney disease, all of which are present in this patient. The decreased reticulocyte count and normal ferritin levels support this diagnosis, indicating the body has iron but is unable to use it properly due to chronic illness.

2. Chronic kidney disease-related anemia - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can lead to a decreased production of erythropoietin, which is necessary for red blood cell production. The patient's elevated creatinine and reduced hemoglobin levels are consistent with this cause. The normocytic anemia (normal MCV) further supports this diagnosis.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding - Given the positive family history of colon cancer and pending fecal occult blood test, gastrointestinal bleeding could be a contributing factor. However, the ferritin levels and lack of overt signs of severe iron deficiency make this less likely but still plausible.",Decreased erythropoietin production,accurate
14,"A boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of fever and productive cough. He has had similar episodes sporadically in the past with frequent episodes of thick, discolored nasal discharge. Physical examination shows diffuse crackles and rhonchi. An x-ray of the chest is shown. The most likely cause of recurrent infections in this patient is a dysfunction of which of the following cell types?","1. *Ciliated epithelial cells* - The description of recurrent respiratory infections, productive cough, and thick nasal discharge, along with physical findings of crackles and rhonchi, strongly suggests a condition like primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), where the dysfunction of ciliated epithelial cells leads to impaired mucociliary clearance.

2. *Neutrophils* - Although less likely given the description, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) with neutrophil dysfunction can also lead to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections of the respiratory tract. However, the presentation of frequent thick nasal discharge aligns less directly with CGD.

3. *Macrophages* - Alveolar macrophages play a crucial role in clearing pathogens from the lungs, but primary immunodeficiencies involving just macrophages are less common and typically present with different infection patterns. Therefore, macrophage dysfunction is a plausible but less likely cause here.",Ciliated columnar cells,accurate
15,"A girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents due to severe shortness of breath that started 20 minutes ago. She has a history of asthma and her current treatment regimen includes a beta-agonist inhaler as well as a medium-dose corticosteroid inhaler. Her mother tells the physician that her daughter was playing outside with her friends when she suddenly started experiencing difficulty breathing and used her inhaler without improvement. On examination, she is struggling to breathe with subcostal and intercostal retractions. She is leaning forward, gasping for air, and refuses to lie down on the examination table. Her blood pressure is 130/92 mm Hg, the respirations are 27/min, the pulse is 110/min, and O2 saturation is 87%. There are prominent expiratory wheezes in all lung fields. The patient is put on a nonrebreather mask with 100% oxygen. An arterial blood gas is collected and sent for analysis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?","1. **Administer nebulized albuterol and ipratropium** - Given her lack of response to her initial inhaler use and her severe symptoms, nebulized albuterol (a rapid-acting beta-agonist) combined with ipratropium (an anticholinergic) can help alleviate severe bronchoconstriction more effectively than the inhaler alone.
   
2. **Administer systemic corticosteroids** - Systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone or methylprednisolone, would address the underlying inflammation contributing to her asthma exacerbation but take a few hours to exert their effect. Therefore, they should be administered promptly after stabilizing her acute symptoms.

3. **Consider magnesium sulfate or heliox as adjunct therapies** - If the patient does not sufficiently respond to the above treatments, magnesium sulfate (a bronchodilator) or heliox (a helium-oxygen mixture to reduce airflow resistance) may be considered to improve ventilation and ease breathing.",Inhaled albuterol,relevant
16,"A woman is referred to a cardiologist for evaluation of syncope. Over the past year she has experienced 2 syncopal events. The first event occurred while she was standing, and the second when she laid down on her side. She denies bowel or bladder incontinence during the episodes or palpitations. However, she reports the presence of a low-grade fever over the past 3 months and a recent visit to the emergency department for a transient ischemic attack. She has a history of intravenous drug use but reports not having used in over 5 years. Temperature is 100.0°F (37.8°C), pressure is 115/72 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 20/min and regular. A detailed neurologic examination reveals no focal deficits. Cardiac auscultation demonstrates a diastolic ""plop"" at the cardiac apex. Which of the following findings will most likely be demonstrated on transthoracic echocardiography?","1. **Left atrial myxoma**: The diastolic ""plop"" sound at the cardiac apex, history of syncope, and presence of a low-grade fever suggest a cardiac myxoma. Left atrial myxomas can obstruct blood flow intermittently, causing syncope, and can also release pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to fever.

2. **Mitral valve prolapse**: While this condition can sometimes lead to syncope, it is less specific given the clinical presentation. Mitral valve prolapse may be noted on echocardiography, but it does not typically explain the fever or the diastolic plop.

3. **Aortic stenosis**: This condition can cause syncope, especially during exertion or positional changes, and might be picked up on echocardiography. However, it is less likely given the description of a diastolic sound and the presence of fever, making left atrial myxoma a more plausible primary diagnosis.",Left atrial pedunculated mass,accurate
17,"A man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He feels well. He has hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Current medications include metoprolol and pantoprazole. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. Temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 135/87 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 43%

Segmented neutrophils 22%
Basophils 1%
Eosinophils 2%
Lymphocytes 74%
Monocytes 1%
Platelet count 190,000/mm3
Blood smear shows small, mature lymphocytes and several smudge cells. Immunophenotypic analysis with flow cytometry shows B-cells that express CD19, CD20 and CD23. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","1. **Observation and regular monitoring** - Given the patient's asymptomatic status and the laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Observation with regular follow-ups is appropriate for early-stage, asymptomatic CLL, as immediate treatment is not necessary until symptoms or disease progression occur.

2. **Bone marrow biopsy** - This can be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to assess the extent of marrow infiltration. While not always immediately necessary if the clinical picture is clear, it can provide valuable prognostic information.

3. **Flow cytometry of peripheral blood** - Though already implied from the immunophenotypic analysis, additional flow cytometry might be warranted to further characterize the abnormal lymphocyte population and confirm the diagnosis of CLL.",Observation and follow-up,accurate
18,"A woman comes to the emergency department because of weakness and fatigue for 2 days. She has also noticed that her urine is darker than usual. For the past week, she has had a persistent non-productive cough and low-grade fever. She has seasonal allergies. She drinks one to two glasses of wine on social occasions and does not smoke. Her temperature is 37.9°C (100.2°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 110/76 mm Hg. She has conjunctival pallor and scleral icterus.

LDH 1,251 U/L
Haptoglobin 5.8 mg/dL (N = 41–165)
An x-ray of the chest shows bilateral patchy infiltrates. A peripheral blood smear shows spherocytes. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?","1. **Direct Coombs test** - This test will detect antibodies or complement proteins attached to the surface of red blood cells, which is indicative of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Given the presence of spherocytes, elevated LDH, low haptoglobin, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia, AIHA is the most likely diagnosis.

2. **Cold agglutinin test** - This test checks for the presence of cold agglutinins, which can cause hemolysis at low temperatures and could also account for similar symptoms, especially if the woman had an infection that caused this response. It's less likely compared to a Direct Coombs test but still relevant.

3. **Parvovirus B19 serology** - Although less likely in this scenario given the presence of hemolytic markers, parvovirus B19 can cause aplastic crises in individuals with preexisting hemolytic anemias, which could be a differential diagnosis.",Direct Coombs test,accurate
19,A woman comes to the physician with concerns about swelling and pain in her right breast. Physical examination shows erythema and prominent pitting of the hair follicles overlying the upper and lower outer quadrants of the right breast. There are no nipple changes or discharge. A core needle biopsy shows invasive carcinoma of the breast. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's skin findings?,"1. **Lymphatic obstruction:** The physical findings of erythema and pitting of the hair follicles (often referred to as peau d'orange) are most consistent with lymphatic obstruction caused by invasive carcinoma of the breast. Cancer cells can invade and block the lymphatic vessels, leading to swelling and characteristic skin changes.

2. **Inflammatory breast cancer:** Although less common, inflammatory breast cancer can present with similar skin changes, including erythema and peau d'orange. This type of breast cancer is highly aggressive and involves the dermal lymphatics, causing rapid changes in the appearance of the skin.

3. **Cellulitis:** While less likely in the context of a biopsy-confirmed invasive carcinoma, severe cellulitis could theoretically cause erythema and pitting of the hair follicles. However, the presence of invasive carcinoma on biopsy makes this less probable.",Obstruction of the lymphatic channels,accurate
20,"A scientist is studying a protein that is present on the plasma membrane of cells. The protein is purified in a lipid bilayer and subjected to various conditions. The investigations reveal the following properties:

1) It changes ion concentrations across the membrane without requiring ATP.

2) Its activity increases linearly with substrate concentration without saturation even under mildly supraphysiologic conditions.

3) It changes ion concentrations only in certain states, while having no effect in other states.

4) Changing the electrical charge across the membrane does not influence its activity.

5) Adding a small amount of an additional substance consistently increases the protein's activity.

These findings are consistent with a protein with which of the following functions?","1. **Ion Channel:** Ion channels can change ion concentrations across the membrane without requiring ATP and their activity can be modulated by certain substances. However, many ion channels do show saturation and are often influenced by the electrical charge across the membrane. Given that the described properties do not entirely match with classic ion channels, this is the second most plausible answer.

2. **Ionophore:** Ionophores are compounds that facilitate the transport of ions across the membrane without requiring ATP. They can change ion concentrations and their activity may increase with the presence of certain substances. Ionophores also do not typically show saturation at physiological ranges, making this the most plausible answer.

3. **Facilitated Diffusion Transporter:** These transporters can move ions across the membrane without requiring ATP and can be regulated by other substances. While they often show saturation kinetics and can be influenced by membrane electrical charge, some non-traditional facilitated diffusion transporters might fit the described properties under certain experimental conditions. Therefore, this is the third most plausible answer.",Mediating neuronal to muscle end plate communication,inaccurate
21,"A male with congestive heart failure recently had his medication regiment adjusted to better control his hypertension. Three weeks later, laboratory analysis shows his serum calcium and magnesium levels have both decreased. The diuretic used in this patient acts predominantly on which nephron segment:","1. **Thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle:** Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, act on this segment and are known to cause decreases in both serum calcium and magnesium levels by inhibiting the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter, leading to increased excretion of these electrolytes.

2. **Distal convoluted tubule:** Thiazide diuretics act on this segment and typically cause a decrease in serum magnesium, but they generally lead to an increase in serum calcium by promoting calcium reabsorption. While this is less likely given the patient's decreased calcium levels, it is worth considering.

3. **Proximal convoluted tubule:** Less commonly implicated but certain diuretics like carbonic anhydrase inhibitors act here. They are not typically associated with significant changes in calcium and magnesium levels comparable to loop diuretics, making this the least likely option among the top three.",Thick ascending loop of Henle,accurate
22,"A G2P1 female at 37 weeks of gestation presents to the clinic for complaints of right-hand numbness and pain for the past month. She reports that the pain is usually worse at night and that she would sometimes wake up in the middle of the night from the “pins and needles.” She denies fever, weakness, or weight changes but endorses paresthesia and pain. The patient also reports a fall on her right hand 2 weeks ago. A physical examination demonstrates mild sensory deficits at the first 3 digits of the right hand but no tenderness with palpation. Strength is intact throughout. Which of the following findings would further support the diagnosis of this patient’s condition?","1. *Positive Tinel's sign*: Tapping over the carpal tunnel elicits tingling or pain in the distribution of the median nerve (1st to 3rd digits), which is indicative of carpal tunnel syndrome.
2. *Positive Phalen’s test*: Holding the wrists in a flexed position for about 60 seconds reproduces symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or pain in the median nerve distribution, further supporting carpal tunnel syndrome.
3. *Electrodiagnostic studies showing delayed median nerve conduction*: Nerve conduction studies that demonstrate slowed conduction velocity or prolonged distal latency of the median nerve can confirm the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.",Tingling when the right wrist is percussed,accurate
23,"A man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter. She reports that her father drank heavily for the last 16 years but stopped 4 days ago after deciding to quit drinking on his birthday. She also reports that he has been talking about seeing cats running in his room since this morning, although there were no cats. There is no history of any known medical problems or any other substance use. On physical examination, his temperature is 38.4ºC (101.2ºF), heart rate is 116/min, blood pressure is 160/94 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 22/min. He is severely agitated and is not oriented to his name, time, or place. On physical examination, profuse perspiration and tremors are present. Which of the following best describes the pathophysiologic mechanism underlying his condition?","1. **Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium (Delirium Tremens)**: The most plausible explanation for this patient's symptoms is alcohol withdrawal delirium, also known as delirium tremens (DTs). DTs usually occur 48 to 72 hours after cessation of heavy alcohol use, but can occur up to 7 days later. The condition is characterized by severe agitation, confusion, hallucinations (such as seeing cats), fever, tachycardia, hypertension, sweating, and tremors. The pathophysiological mechanism involves a hyperadrenergic state due to the sudden removal of the central nervous system depressant (alcohol). This results in an upregulation of excitatory neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate) and a downregulation of inhibitory neurotransmitters (e.g., GABA).

2. **Alcoholic Hallucinosis**: Another possible explanation is alcoholic hallucinosis, which is a condition characterized by hallucinations (often auditory, but can be visual or tactile) occurring within 12 to 24 hours of the last drink and can last up to 48 hours. However, alcoholic hallucinosis typically does not present with the severe autonomic instability (elevated heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature) or profound disorientation that this patient is experiencing.

3. **Wernicke Encephalopathy**: Wernicke encephalopathy, due to thiamine deficiency commonly seen in chronic alcoholics, could also be a consideration. It typically presents with a triad of confusion, ataxia (lack of muscle coordination), and ophthalmoplegia (eye movement abnormalities). Although some symptoms like confusion and disorientation match, the presence of hallucinations and significant autonomic hyperactivity is less consistent with Wernicke encephalopathy. 

Thus, the best explanation is alcohol withdrawal delirium (delirium tremens).",Increased activity of NMDA receptors,Relevant
24,"A 2-week-old female newborn is brought to the physician for the evaluation of red eyes with discharge for 2 days. She was born at 39 weeks' gestation to a woman. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. The mother received irregular prenatal care during the second half of the pregnancy. The newborn weighed 3700 g (8 lb 2.5 oz) at birth, and no congenital anomalies were noted. She currently weighs 4000 g (8 lb 13 oz). Examination of the newborn shows pink skin. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is mucopurulent discharge in both eyes and mild eyelid swelling. Polymerase chain reaction assay of conjunctival scraping confirms the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","1. **Oral erythromycin therapy** - This is the most appropriate treatment for neonatal Chlamydia trachomatis conjunctivitis, which is likely given the age of onset and the symptoms described.

2. **Topical erythromycin ointment** - Although it is more commonly used for prophylaxis and would be less effective alone compared to oral treatment, it can be considered as an adjunct treatment for Chlamydia trachomatis.

3. **Intravenous ceftriaxone** - This would be considered if Neisseria gonorrhoeae conjunctivitis were suspected. However, the diagnosis here strongly points towards Chlamydia trachomatis, for which oral erythromycin is the treatment of choice.",Oral erythromycin administration,accurate
25,A boy is brought to the physician because of a 1-day history of severe left hand pain. He has had similar painful episodes in the past that required hospitalization. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae. There is tenderness on palpation of the wrist and the small joints of the left hand. Peripheral blood smear shows crescent-shaped erythrocytes. He is started on a pharmacologic agent that is known to cause macrocytosis. This drug causes an arrest in which of the following cell cycle phases?,"1. **S phase** - The drug causing macrocytosis is likely to be hydroxyurea, which works by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, leading to arrest during the DNA synthesis (S) phase of the cell cycle.

2. **G2 phase** - Some drugs can impact the G2 phase by interfering with DNA repair mechanisms, although this is less specific in the context of causing macrocytosis.

3. **M phase** - Though less likely, certain chemotherapeutic agents that induce macrocytosis can arrest cells in the mitosis (M) phase, though this is not typically associated with the drug likely used in this scenario.",S phase,accurate

During this period, he has also had nausea, heartburn, and multiple episodes of diarrhea with no blood or mucus. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 18 years. He does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Current medications include an antacid. The abdomen is soft and there is tenderness to palpation in the epigastric and umbilical areas. Upper endoscopy shows several ulcers in the duodenum and the upper jejunum as well as thick gastric folds. Gastric pH is < 2. Biopsies from the ulcers show no organisms. Which of the following tests is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?","1. *Serum gastrin level*: The man's symptoms, along with the presence of multiple ulcers in the duodenum and upper jejunum and thick gastric folds, are suggestive of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES), a condition characterized by excessive gastrin production typically due to a gastrin-secreting tumor (gastrinoma). Measuring the serum gastrin level can help confirm this diagnosis as patients with ZES usually have markedly elevated gastrin levels.

2. *Secretin stimulation test*: If the serum gastrin level is borderline or moderately elevated, a secretin stimulation test can be used to further evaluate the possibility of ZES. In this test, secretin is administered and serum gastrin levels are measured. Patients with ZES typically exhibit a pronounced increase in gastrin levels following secretin administration.

3. *Fasting serum chromogranin A (CgA) level*: Chromogranin A is a marker for neuroendocrine tumors, including gastrinomas. Elevated levels of CgA can support the diagnosis of a gastrinoma. However, this test is less specific than serum gastrin measurement and can be influenced by other factors, making it a supplementary test rather than a primary diagnostic tool.",Fasting serum gastrin level,accurate

The abdomen is distended, the anus is patent, and the rectal examination reveals pale mucous with non-pigmented meconium. Based on a barium enema, the boy is diagnosed with sigmoid colonic atresia. Disruption of which structure during fetal development could lead to this anomaly?","1. *Inferior Mesenteric Artery* - The inferior mesenteric artery supplies blood to the distal part of the colon (including the sigmoid colon). Disruption of its blood flow during fetal development can lead to ischemia and subsequent atresia of the affected segment.

2. *Umbilical Arteries* - These arteries are involved in fetal circulation and supply blood to various pelvic organs and structures. Issues with the umbilical arteries could lead to compromised blood flow affecting the development of the lower gastrointestinal tract and colon.

3. *Hindgut* - The hindgut is the embryonic precursor to the distal colon, sigmoid colon, rectum, and part of the anal canal. Abnormal development or disruption in the differentiation or recanalization of the hindgut can result in congenital anomalies such as colonic atresia.",Inferior mesenteric artery,accurate

She denies any history of smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. She is a widow, lives alone, and is able to perform all activities of daily living (ADLs) easily. There is no significant family history. She is afebrile and her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following would be the most appropriate response to her request to take Ginkgo?","1. **Discuss potential risks of bleeding**: Explain to the patient that Ginkgo biloba can increase the risk of bleeding, especially when taken with medications like aspirin. Given her history of an acute cardiac event and her current use of aspirin, it is important to avoid any additional bleeding risks.

2. **Evaluate and address other causes of memory loss**: Suggest that her memory problems could be due to several potential factors, including stress, sleep issues, or mild cognitive impairment. Recommend a thorough evaluation by her primary care physician or a neurologist to rule out any underlying conditions that might be causing her memory concerns.

3. **Consider a comprehensive approach to cognitive health**: Recommend non-pharmacological approaches to improve cognitive function, such as regular physical exercise, mental stimulation activities (e.g., puzzles, reading), social engagement, and a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids. Additionally, discuss the importance of managing cardiovascular health to prevent further cognitive decline.","""No, taking ginkgo will increase your risk for bleeding.""",accurate

He reports that his symptoms occur within an hour of eating a meal and persist for approximately an hour. He admits his symptoms have been progressively worsening. He recently began having these symptoms when he lies in the supine position. He has tried eating smaller meals and avoiding spicy food to no avail. He denies vomiting, difficulty swallowing, recent weight loss, or changes in stool color. He does admit to having a ""sour"" taste in his mouth when symptomatic.

Hematocrit: 41%
Leukocyte count: 4,500/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 257,000/mm^3
Fecal occult blood test (FOBT): Negative

Which of the following is the next best step in management?","1. *Initiate a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trial*: Given the patient's history of heartburn, epigastric pain, and symptoms worsening in the supine position, as well as the ""sour"" taste in his mouth, the most likely diagnosis is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). A PPI trial is a commonly accepted initial step in managing GERD and can help alleviate symptoms by reducing stomach acid production.

2. *Lifestyle modifications and dietary adjustments*: Although the patient has already tried eating smaller meals and avoiding spicy foods, additional recommendations such as avoiding eating late at night, elevating the head of the bed, and losing weight (given his BMI of 32 kg/m^2) could further help manage his symptoms. 

3. *Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD)*: If symptoms persist despite appropriate medical therapy with PPIs, or if there are alarm features like weight loss, dysphagia, or signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, an upper GI endoscopy would be indicated to evaluate for complications such as esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, or peptic ulcer disease. Although this is not the immediate next step, it is crucial for further investigation if initial treatments are unsuccessful.",Omeprazole,Accurate
30,"A healthy nulligravid woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. Her brother has a disease that has resulted in infertility, a right-sided heart, and frequent sinus and ear infections. No other family members are affected. The intended father has no history of this disease. The population prevalence of this disease is 1 in 40,000. Which of the following best represents the chance that this woman’s offspring will develop her brother's disease?","1. *1.2%* - The most plausible estimate takes into account the potential carrier status of the woman. Since she is a sibling of an affected individual, there is a 2/3 chance she is a carrier (assuming autosomal recessive inheritance). Given the population prevalence, the carrier frequency q can be approximately calculated as 1/100 (since q^2 = 1/40,000). The intended father, having no history of the disease, would then have a carrier probability of 1/100. The chance of the offspring being affected is thus (2/3) * (1/100) * (1/4) ≈ 1/600 ≈ 0.17%.

2. *0.25%* - This answer assumes that the disease might have some underlying genetic heterogeneity or exceptions which could slightly lower the risk calculation. With the same carrier probability of the woman and an approximate population carrier rate, the chance of the offspring being affected could be approximated considering additional minor factors, potentially lowering the estimate.

3. *2%* - Considering common population genetics and autosomal recessive inheritance, a slight overestimation might put the risk at about 2%, accounting for factors like increased awareness or earlier carrier detection, slightly higher population-based risks, or misinterpreted population prevalence.",0.2%,relevant
31,"A drug research team has synthesized a novel oral drug that acts as an agonist at multiple adrenergic receptors. When administered in animals, it has been shown to produce urinary retention at therapeutic doses with the absence of other manifestations of adrenergic stimulation. The researchers are interested in understanding the signal transduction and molecular mechanisms behind the action of the novel drug. Which of the following receptors would most likely transduce signals across the plasma membrane following the administration of this novel drug?","1. **Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (α1-ARs)** - These receptors are known to mediate smooth muscle contraction, including in the bladder neck and prostate. Activation of α1-ARs by the novel drug would lead to increased smooth muscle tone in these areas, resulting in urinary retention.

2. **Beta-3 adrenergic receptors (β3-ARs)** - While primarily involved in lipolysis and thermogenesis, β3-ARs are also found in the bladder. Agonism of β3-ARs can relax the bladder detrusor muscle, contributing to urinary retention via reduced bladder contractility.

3. **Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors (α2-ARs)** - These receptors function mainly through inhibitory pathways, often leading to decreased neurotransmitter release. Their activation can modulate the release of norepinephrine and may indirectly contribute to urinary retention by affecting autonomic control of the bladder.",GqPCRs (Gq protein-coupled receptors),relevant

Prior to this pregnancy, she had no significant medical history. She takes a prenatal vitamin and folate supplements daily. Her mother has diabetes, and her brother has coronary artery disease. On physical examination, the fundal height is 25 centimeters. A fetal ultrasound shows a proportional reduction in head circumference, trunk size, and limb length. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient’s presentation?","1. Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) - This condition can result in a proportional reduction in head circumference, trunk size, and limb length. Causes of IUGR could include placental insufficiency, maternal malnutrition, or chronic medical conditions. Although the mother did not have significant medical history before pregnancy, it is still a common reason for such ultrasound findings.

2. Congenital Infection - Infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) or toxoplasmosis can cause symmetrical growth restrictions and may present later in pregnancy. Given the lack of significant medical history and the sudden onset of symptoms, a congenital infection could be a possible cause.

3. Genetic or Chromosomal Abnormalities - Conditions such as Down syndrome or other chromosomal abnormalities can lead to symmetrical growth restriction. Although these are usually identified earlier in pregnancy, they remain a consideration given the ultrasound findings.",Rubella infection,relevant

Examination shows a 4-cm (1.6-in), nontender, pulsatile mass with a palpable thrill at the right midinguinal point. On auscultation, a harsh continuous murmur is heard over the mass. Femoral and pedal pulses are palpable bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","1. **Femoral artery pseudoaneurysm** - The described nontender, pulsatile mass with a palpable thrill and continuous murmur strongly suggests a pseudoaneurysm, especially given the patient's history of smoking and vascular risk factors.

2. **Femoral arteriovenous fistula** - The presence of a palpable thrill and continuous murmur could also indicate an arteriovenous fistula, which involves an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein. However, the presentation of a pseudoaneurysm fits more closely with the clinical description.

The patient states that he is experiencing back and flank pain and is tender to palpation over his lumbar back and flanks. The patient is given 3 liters of Lactated Ringer solution and his blood pressure improves to 110/70 mmHg and his pulse is 95/min. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","1. **Computed Tomography (CT) angiography of the abdomen and pelvis:** Given the symptoms of back and flank pain, hypotension, and responsiveness to fluid resuscitation, the immediate concern is the possibility of retroperitoneal hemorrhage, especially after a recent cardiac catheterization procedure. CT angiography can help identify any vascular complications such as a hematoma or active bleeding that might need urgent intervention.

2. **Bedside ultrasound (FAST scan):** A focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) can be quickly performed at the bedside to evaluate the presence of free fluid in the abdomen or pelvis, suggestive of internal bleeding. This is a rapid, non-invasive first step that can guide further management decisions.

The trauma surgery resident initiates the massive transfusion protocol and orders whole blood, O negative, which she explains is the universal donor. The patient receives 6 units of O negative blood prior to admission. He subsequently develops fever, chills, hematuria, and pulmonary edema. Several hours later, the patient goes into hemodynamic shock requiring the emergent administration of vasopressors. Of the following options, which hypersensitivity reaction occurred?","1. **Acute Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (AHTR)** - This is likely the best answer given the presentation of fever, chills, hematuria, and subsequent progression to hemodynamic shock after transfusion, which are classic signs of AHTR. It occurs due to the recipient's immune system attacking the transfused red blood cells.

2. **Febrile Non-Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (FNHTR)** - This can present with fever and chills post-transfusion, but it is less severe and does not typically cause hematuria or lead to hemodynamic shock. Thus, it is less likely than AHTR but still a possible consideration given the fever and chills.

3. **Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)** - This is a serious reaction characterized by pulmonary edema and respiratory distress, which the patient developed.

He does not smoke, drink, or consume any drugs. He appears upset. His vital signs are within normal limits. Despite the pressure by the police, he refuses to undergo any further medical evaluation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient?","1. **Observation and Monitoring**: Given the potential risk of cocaine toxicity and the serious health implications, the most appropriate next step would be to closely observe and monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of cocaine toxicity. This includes regular checks of vital signs, cardiac monitoring, and observing for any signs of gastrointestinal distress or other complications. While respecting the patient's autonomy, it is crucial to ensure that he is medically stable and does not develop life-threatening symptoms.

2. **Informed Consent and Legal Considerations**: Attempt to obtain informed consent from the patient for further evaluation. This involves clearly explaining the risks associated with ingested cocaine capsules, the potential for serious complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or acute cocaine toxicity, and the need for medical assessment. In situations where the patient continues to refuse and there is a significant immediate risk to his health, legal measures may be necessary to ensure his safety.

3. **Non-invasive Imaging (If Consent is Obtained)**: If the patient is willing to proceed with further evaluation, an abdominal X-ray or a CT scan can be performed to detect the presence of foreign bodies (the cocaine-containing capsules) in the gastrointestinal tract.

39,An outbreak of diphtheria has occurred for the third time in a decade in a small village in South Africa. Diphtheria is endemic to the area with many healthy villagers colonized with different bacterial strains. Vaccine distribution in this area is difficult due to treacherous terrain. A team of doctors is sent to the region to conduct a health campaign. Toxigenic strains of C. diphtheria are isolated from symptomatic patients. What best explains the initial emergence of a pathogenic strain causing such outbreaks?,"1. The initial emergence of a pathogenic strain causing such outbreaks is most likely due to the presence of bacteriophages carrying the diphtheria toxin gene (tox gene) that have infected non-toxigenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae in the population. This process, known as lysogenic conversion, results in the non-toxigenic bacteria acquiring the ability to produce diphtheria toxin, transforming them into toxigenic strains capable of causing disease.

2. Another plausible explanation is the low vaccination coverage in the area due to the difficult terrain, which results in a larger segment of the population being susceptible to infection. This allows the toxigenic strains to spread more easily and cause outbreaks, as the herd immunity threshold is not reached.

3. It is possible that environmental or social changes in the village, such as increased population density or altered patterns of interaction, have facilitated the spread of the pathogenic strain. These changes might enhance the transmission dynamics of C. diphtheriae, contributing to the recurrent outbreaks.",Lysogenic conversion,accurate

He does not recall receiving any vaccinations in the last 30 years and does not know if he was vaccinated as a child. What is the appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis?","1. **Administer Tetanus Immune Globulin (TIG) and Tetanus Toxoid-containing vaccine (Tdap or Td):** Given that the patient has a deep laceration from a soiled and rusted piece of metal, he is at high risk for tetanus. Because he does not recall having vaccinations in the past 30 years and potentially never received full immunization, he should receive TIG for immediate passive immunity and a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine for active immunity.

2. **Clean and debride the wound thoroughly:** Proper wound management is crucial in preventing infection. Cleaning and debriding the wound reduces the risk of tetanus and other bacterial infections.

3. **Provide antibiotics as prophylaxis for infection:** Although the primary concern is tetanus, the laceration is secondary to a rusted and soiled object, increasing the risk of bacterial infection.

Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 110/76 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination and an x-ray of the chest show no abnormalities. Her FEV1 is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","1. Evaluate for upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) – Also known as postnasal drip, this condition could be causing the patient's persistent cough, especially given her history of a runny nose every morning during the winter. Treatment typically involves a trial of first-generation antihistamines or intranasal corticosteroids.

2. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness testing – Even though her FEV1 is normal, a methacholine challenge test could be useful to rule out asthma as a cause of chronic cough, which can present with nocturnal symptoms and a nonproductive cough.

3. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) evaluation – Even in the absence of typical GERD symptoms, it can still be a cause of chronic cough. A trial of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may be considered to see if there is any improvement in the cough.",Oral diphenhydramine,relevant
45,"A woman is brought to the emergency department with dyspnea for 2 days. She is on regular hemodialysis at 3 sessions a week but missed her last session due to an unexpected trip. She has a history of congestive heart failure. After urgent hemodialysis, the patient’s dyspnea does not improve as expected. The cardiologist is consulted. After evaluation of the patient, he notes in the patient’s electronic record: “the patient does not have a chronic heart condition and a cardiac cause of dyspnea is unlikely.” The following morning, the nurse finds the cardiologist’s notes about the patient not having congestive heart failure odd. The patient had a clear history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%. After further investigation, the nurse realizes that the cardiologist evaluated the patient’s roommate, an elderly woman with a similar first name. She is also on chronic hemodialysis. To prevent similar future errors, the most appropriate strategy is to use which of the following?","1. **Two-Patient Identifiers**: Implement a strict policy that requires the use of at least two patient identifiers, such as the patient's full name and date of birth, before any clinical evaluation or intervention. This helps ensure the correct patient is being assessed or treated.

2. **Electronic Health Record (EHR) Alerts**: Develop and utilize EHR systems that incorporate real-time alerts and confirmation prompts when accessing patient records. These alerts can help verify patient identity and avoid mix-ups.

3. **Standardized Patient Rooming Protocols**: Establish standardized protocols for rooming patients that include precise labeling of rooms and patient wristbands with clear, readable information to reduce the chance of mistaken identity. This can also involve patient self-identification processes where patients confirm their identity verbally.",Two patient identifiers at every patient encounter by any healthcare provider,accurate
46,"A female is brought to the emergency department by her husband 1 hour after the onset of chest palpitations. Her symptoms began suddenly while she was drinking coffee and have persisted since then. She has not had shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or loss of consciousness. She has experienced these palpitations before, but they typically resolve spontaneously within a few minutes. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 155/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Physical examination shows no abnormalities other than tachycardia. An ECG is shown. Repeated, forceful exhalation against a closed glottis while supine fails to relieve her symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","1. **Administer Adenosine**: Adenosine is the primary treatment for stable supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) when vagal maneuvers are ineffective. It works by transiently blocking AV node conduction and can quickly terminate the tachycardia.

2. **Attempt Carotid Sinus Massage**: If initial vagal maneuvers such as the Valsalva maneuver fail, carotid sinus massage can be a useful next step. This also stimulates the vagus nerve and can help convert the rhythm.

3. **Administer Beta-Blocker or Calcium Channel Blocker**: If adenosine is contraindicated or not effective, a beta-blocker (e.g., metoprolol) or a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (e.g., diltiazem or verapamil) can be used to manage the tachycardia by slowing AV node conduction.",Administer adenosine intravenously,accurate
47,A man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of epigastric pain and a 9-kg (20-lb) weight loss. He feels full and bloated even after eating small portions of food. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.5 g/dL with a mean corpuscular volume of 78 μm3. Test of the stool for occult blood is positive. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy shows a 2-cm raised lesion with central ulceration on the lesser curvature of the stomach. Histologic examination of a gastric biopsy specimen from the lesion is most likely to show which of the following?,"1. **Adenocarcinoma** - Given the 6-month history of epigastric pain, significant weight loss, anemia with low MCV indicating chronic blood loss, and an endoscopic finding of a raised lesion with central ulceration, gastric adenocarcinoma is the most likely diagnosis. This type of cancer commonly presents with these symptoms and findings.

2. **Gastric lymphoma** - While less common than adenocarcinoma, gastric lymphoma can also present with similar epigastric pain, weight loss, anemia, and ulcerative lesions in the stomach. It would be a plausible secondary diagnosis.

3. **Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)** - GISTs can present with nonspecific symptoms including abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and weight loss. Endoscopic findings might show a lesion with central ulceration, making it a possible but less likely diagnosis compared to adenocarcinoma and lymphoma.",Gland-forming cuboidal cells,inaccurate
48,"A woman is brought to a counselor by her father after he found out that she is being physically abused by her husband. The father reports that she refuses to end the relationship with her husband despite the physical abuse. She says that she feels uneasy when her husband is not around. She adds, “I'm worried that if I leave him, my life will only get worse.” She has never been employed since they got married because she is convinced that nobody would hire her. Her husband takes care of most household errands and pays all of the bills. Physical examination shows several bruises on the thighs and back. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","*1. Battered Woman Syndrome (BWS)* - This diagnosis is part of a broader category of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experienced by victims of chronic intimate partner violence. Symptoms can include emotional dependency on the abuser, low self-esteem, and a fear that leaving will result in worse circumstances.

*2. Dependent Personality Disorder (DPD)* - This disorder is characterized by an excessive need to be taken care of, leading to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation. It explains the woman's inability to leave her abusive husband and her belief that she cannot survive without him.

*3. Learned Helplessness* - This psychological condition occurs when a person has been subjected to repeated stressful or abusive situations and eventually becomes unable to take actions to change their circumstances. It leads to feelings of powerlessness and resignation, often seen in victims of long-term abuse.",Dependent personality disorder,accurate
49,"A homeless HIV-positive male presents with numbness in his hands and feet. The patient says that his symptoms started gradually a couple of weeks ago and have slowly worsened. He describes numbness initially in just his fingertips and toes, but it has now spread to involve his entire hands and feet. Past medical history is significant for HIV diagnosed many years ago, for which the patient has never sought treatment. The patient also has a long history of various illnesses, especially chronic diarrhea, but he is unable to remember any details. He currently takes no medications. The patient has been homeless for years, and he denies any alcohol or drug use. Review of systems is significant for a sore tongue. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure is 100/65 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, respiratory rate is 25/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. On physical exam, the patient is alert and oriented, his body habitus is cachectic, and his BMI is 17 kg/m2. His tongue appears erythematous and smooth with loss of papillae, but no lesions or evidence of infection is noted. Cardiac exam is normal apart from tachycardia. Lungs are clear to auscultation. His abdomen is soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly. There is decreased 2-point discrimination in the hands and feet bilaterally. Strength in the hands and feet is 4/5 bilaterally. Reflexes are absent in the ankles. Gait is slightly wide-based and ataxic, and there is a positive Romberg sign. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?","1. **Vitamin B12 Deficiency**: The sore tongue, pallor, and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy—including numbness in the hands and feet, ataxic gait, and positive Romberg sign—strongly suggest vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient's cachectic state, chronic diarrhea, and poor nutrition due to homelessness may have led to this deficiency.

2. **HIV-Associated Neuropathy**: Given the patient's history of untreated HIV, it is possible that the numbness and other neuropathic symptoms are due to HIV-associated neuropathy. This is a common complication in HIV-positive individuals, particularly those with advanced disease and poor treatment adherence.

3. **Alcoholic Neuropathy**: Although the patient denies alcohol use, chronic alcoholism is a common cause of peripheral neuropathy. The described symptoms—numbness progressing from distal to proximal extremities, along with ataxia and reflex changes—can be consistent with this condition if the patient's history of alcohol use were not accurately reported. However, this is less likely given the denial of alcohol use.",Elevated levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA),relevant
