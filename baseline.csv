0,"A 70-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of an 8-week history of blood in his stool. Two months ago, he had an episode of bronchitis and was treated with amoxicillin. Since then, he has noticed blood in his stool and on the toilet paper occasionally. The patient has had intermittent constipation for the past 5 years. Six months ago, he had severe left lower quadrant pain and fever that resolved with antibiotic therapy. He underwent a colonoscopy 3 years ago, which did not show any evidence of malignancy. He takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 45 years, but quit smoking 10 years ago. He drinks one glass of red wine every night. He appears pale. He is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 98 kg (216 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly. Digital rectal examination shows no masses. Test of the stool for occult blood is positive. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 11 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 76 μm3
Red cell distribution width 17% (N = 13–15)

17,"A 24-year-old man presents to his family practitioner for routine follow-up of asthma. He is currently on albuterol, corticosteroids, and salmeterol, all via inhalation. The patient is compliant with his medications, but he still complains of episodic shortness of breath and wheezing. The peak expiratory flow (PEF) has improved since the last visit, but it is still less than the ideal predicted values based on age, gender, and height. Montelukast is added to his treatment regimen. What is the mechanism of action of this drug?","*1*  Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that works by blocking the action of leukotrienes, which are inflammatory mediators involved in the pathophysiology of asthma. By inhibiting leukotrienes, montelukast helps reduce inflammation, bronchoconstriction, and mucus production in the airways, providing additional benefit in treating asthma symptoms.

*2*  Montelukast is known to selectively antagonize the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor CysLT1, which is responsible for the effects of leukotrienes in the bronchi. By specifically targeting this receptor, montelukast can effectively inhibit the constriction of airway smooth muscle and decrease inflammation in the lungs, thereby improving asthma symptoms.

*3*  Montelukast inhibits the synthesis of leukotrienes by blocking the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase, which is essential for the production of these inflammatory mediators. By interfering with the production of leukotrienes, montelukast can help reduce the bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, and inflammation in the airways associated with asthma, leading to improved respiratory function and symptom control.

18,"A 59-year-old female presents to your office with complaints of progressive numbness and tingling in her fingers and toes over the last several months. She also reports ""feeling weak"" in her arms and legs. The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension and Crohn's disease, which has been well-controlled since undergoing an ileocolectomy 7 years ago. Physical examination is significant for the following findings: decreased sensation to light touch, temperature, and vibration in the bilateral lower extremities; ataxia; positive Romberg sign. Deficiency of which of the following is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?","1. **Vitamin B12**: Given the patient's history of Crohn's disease and complaints of numbness, tingling, and weakness in a stocking-glove distribution, a deficiency in vitamin B12 is the most likely cause. Patients with Crohn's disease are at an increased risk for developing vitamin B12 deficiency due to malabsorption issues, especially after undergoing ileocolectomy. The neurological symptoms described (paresthesias, weakness, ataxia, positive Romberg sign) are consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency.

2. **Vitamin B6**: Vitamin B6 deficiency may also present with neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, but it is not as common as vitamin B12 deficiency in Crohn's disease. However, it is still a possibility and should be considered as a differential.

3. **Iron**: Iron deficiency anemia can lead to symptoms such as fatigue and weakness, but it is less likely to cause the neurological symptoms described by the patient. Iron deficiency is a common complication in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, like Crohn's disease, but it is not the primary cause of the neurological symptoms in this case.",Vitamin B12,Relevant
