0,"A 69-year-old African American man is brought to the emergency department with sudden onset lower limb paralysis and back pain. He has had generalized bone pain for 2 months. He has no history of severe illnesses. He takes ibuprofen for pain. On examination, he is pale. The vital signs include: temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse 68/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and blood pressure 155/90 mm Hg. The neurologic examination shows paraparesis. The 8th thoracic vertebra is tender to palpation. An X-ray of the thoracic vertebrae confirms a compression fracture at the same level. The laboratory studies show the following:
Laboratory test
Hemoglobin 9 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 95 μm3
Leukocyte count 5,000/mm3
Platelet count 240,000/mm3
ESR 85 mm/hour
Serum
Na+ 135 mEq/L
K+ 4.2 mEq/L

HCO3− 20 mEq/L
Ca+ 11.5 mg/dL
Albumin 4 g/dL
Urea nitrogen 18 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL
Serum electrophoresis shows a monoclonal protein level of 38 g/L. To reduce the likelihood of fracture recurrence, it is most appropriate to administer which of the following?","1. **Bisphosphonates** - Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid or pamidronate, are the treatment of choice for reducing skeletal-related events, including fractures, in patients with multiple myeloma. These drugs work to inhibit bone resorption and can help reduce the risk of further fractures.

2. **Denosumab** - Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that also helps decrease bone resorption by inhibiting the RANK ligand. This treatment can be considered, especially for patients who may not tolerate bisphosphonates or have renal insufficiency.

3. **Radiation therapy** - Radiotherapy might be considered for pain control and localized tumor control in the setting of a vertebral fracture due to multiple myeloma. However, it is not as systemic in its benefits compared to bisphosphonates or denosumab in preventing further fractures.",Pamidronate,accurate
1,"A 48-year-old male accountant presents to the family practice clinic for his first health check-up in years. He has no complaints, and as far as he is concerned, he is well. He does not have any known medical conditions. With respect to the family history, the patient reports that his wife's brother died of a heart attack at 35 years of age. His blood pressure is 140/89 mm Hg and his heart rate is 89/min. Physical examination is otherwise unremarkable. What is the single best initial management for this patient?","1. **Lifestyle modifications:** The initial management should focus on lifestyle changes, including dietary modifications (e.g., DASH diet, reducing salt intake), regular physical activity (e.g., 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week), weight loss if he is overweight, quitting smoking if applicable, and limiting alcohol intake. These changes can help reduce blood pressure and overall cardiovascular risk.

2. **Routine blood tests:** It is prudent to conduct routine blood tests, including lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, and renal function tests, to assess for underlying conditions like hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or potential kidney disease that could be contributing to hypertension.

3. **Monitoring blood pressure:** Schedule follow-up appointments to recheck his blood pressure. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or home blood pressure monitoring can provide a more accurate assessment of his blood pressure over time and help determine if antihypertensive medication is necessary in the future.",Return to the clinic for a repeat blood pressure reading and counseling on the importance of aerobic exercise.,relevant
2,"A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department with leg pain. He states that the pain started suddenly while he was walking outside. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and atrial fibrillation. His temperature is 99.3°F (37.4°C), blood pressure is 152/98 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a cold and pale left leg. The patient’s sensation is markedly diminished in the left leg when compared to the right, and his muscle strength is 1/5 in his left leg. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","1. **Initiate Heparin and Urgent Vascular Surgery Consultation**: The patient's acute onset of leg pain, cold and pale extremity, diminished sensation, and reduced muscle strength strongly suggest acute limb ischemia, likely due to an embolic event given his history of atrial fibrillation. Immediate anticoagulation with heparin is necessary to prevent further thrombus propagation, and rapid consultation with vascular surgery is critical for potential revascularization.

2. **Perform Doppler Ultrasound of the Left Leg**: A Doppler ultrasound can help confirm the diagnosis by identifying arterial occlusion. However, given the urgency of the symptoms, this should be performed quickly in conjunction with initiating anticoagulation and consulting vascular surgery.

3. **Administer IV Fluids and Analgesia**: While stabilizing the patient and managing pain is important, this should not delay definitive treatment for the likely limb-threatening ischemia. Administering IV fluids can support overall perfusion, and analgesics can provide pain relief, but these steps are secondary to initiating heparin and arranging for immediate vascular intervention.",Heparin drip,accurate
3,"An 82-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her daughter because of a 3-day history of a runny nose, headache, and cough. The patient's grandson recently had similar symptoms. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 99%. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Testing of nasal secretions is performed to identify the viral strain. Electron microscopy shows a non-enveloped RNA virus with an icosahedral capsid. Binding to which of the following is responsible for the virulence of this virus?","1. *Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)* - The most plausible answer is that the virus in question is a rhinovirus, a common cause of the symptoms described. Rhinoviruses are non-enveloped RNA viruses with an icosahedral capsid that use ICAM-1 as a cellular receptor to enter and infect human cells, leading to symptoms of the common cold.

2. *CD55 (Decay-accelerating factor)* - Another plausible answer is that the virus could be an echovirus, a type of enterovirus. Echoviruses also have an icosahedral capsid and are non-enveloped RNA viruses. They use CD55 as their receptor.

3. *CD46 (Membrane cofactor protein)* - Although less common, this could apply to certain strains of adenovirus, which can also display non-enveloped icosahedral structures and use CD46 as a receptor. Adenoviruses are known to cause respiratory infections but are generally enveloped, making this a less likely but possible answer.",ICAM-1,accurate
4,"A 3-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of a 2-day history of poor feeding and lethargy. He was born at term and has had three episodes of bilateral otitis media since birth. Umbilical cord separation occurred at the age of 8 weeks. He is at the 30th percentile for height and 20th percentile for weight. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F) and blood pressure is 58/36 mm Hg. Physical examination shows white oral patches and confluent scaly erythematous skin lesions in the groin. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 41,300/mm3 (92% segmented neutrophils and 8% lymphocytes) and a platelet count of 224,000/mm3. Blood cultures at 20°C (68°F) grow catalase-positive yeast cells that form pseudohyphae. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?","1. Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) - This immunodeficiency disorder involves a defect in the NADPH oxidase complex, leading to impaired killing of catalase-positive organisms like Candida. The boy's recurrent infections, poor response to pathogens and the catalase-positive yeast in blood cultures strongly suggest CGD.

2. Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) - This is a life-threatening condition where both T and B lymphocyte functions are impaired, leading to severe infections early in life. The recurrent infections, failure to thrive, and severe candidiasis support this diagnosis.

3. Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD) - This disorder involves defects in the adhesion molecules needed for neutrophil migration, which can cause recurrent bacterial infections and delayed umbilical cord separation, fitting with the patient's history and presentation.",Defective beta-2 integrin,accurate
5,"A 41-year-old woman comes to the doctor because of gradually progressive weakness in her right hand over the past few weeks. She goes to the gym to lift weights 5 times a week. With the dorsum of the right hand on a flat surface, the patient is unable to move her thumb to touch a pen held 2 cm above the interphalangeal joint of the thumb. An MRI of the right arm shows compression of a nerve that passes through the pronator teres muscle. Based on the examination findings, loss of innervation of which of the following muscles is most likely in this patient?","1. Flexor pollicis longus
2. Flexor digitorum profundus (lateral half)
3. Pronator quadratus",Abductor pollicis brevis,inaccurate
6,A young couple expecting their first child present to the obstetrician for routine follow up at 16 weeks gestation. The father suffers from Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and wants to know if is possible that he has passed down the disease to his unborn daughter. The correct response is:,"1. **No, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a mitochondrial disorder, and mitochondrial DNA is inherited exclusively from the mother.** Therefore, the father cannot pass down LHON to his offspring.

2. **The unborn child would only be at risk if the mother carries the mitochondrial mutation associated with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.** The paternal lineage does not contribute to mitochondrial inheritance.

3. **Genetic counseling for mitochondrial disorders typically focuses on the maternal lineage.** It would be advisable for the couple to discuss the mother's mitochondrial DNA to fully assess the risk for their child, but the father's condition does not pose a genetic risk in this context.","No, the father cannot pass the disease to any offpring.",accurate
7,A 32-year-old man comes to the physician with difficulty swallowing for several weeks. Examination of the oropharynx shows lesions on palate and tongue that can be easily scraped off. An image of the lesions is shown. Which of the following is a risk factor for this patient's findings?,"1. **HIV/AIDS**: Immunocompromised states such as HIV/AIDS significantly increase the risk of oral candidiasis, which typically presents with white lesions that can be easily scraped off.
2. **Diabetes Mellitus**: Poorly controlled diabetes can predispose individuals to oral infections, including candidiasis, due to a compromised immune system and higher glucose levels in saliva.
3. **Use of Inhaled Corticosteroids**: Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids for asthma or other respiratory conditions can lead to oral candidiasis as a side effect due to local immune suppression in the oral cavity.",Decline in CD4+ T-cells,relevant
8,"A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of increasing swelling of his legs and generalized fatigue for 1 month. During this period he has also had a productive cough and shortness of breath. He has been unable to carry out his daily activities. He has a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections and chronic nasal congestion since childhood. He has a 3-month history of foul-smelling and greasy stools. He is at 4th percentile for height and weight. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 23/min, and blood pressure is 104/64 mm Hg. Examination shows clubbing of his fingers and scoliosis. There is 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. Jugular venous distention is present. Inspiratory crackles are heard in the thorax. Cardiac examination shows a loud S2. The abdomen is mildly distended and the liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Hepato-jugular reflux is present. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","1. **Cystic Fibrosis**: This diagnosis is suggested by the combination of recurrent respiratory tract infections, chronic nasal congestion, foul-smelling and greasy stools (steatorrhea), clubbing, and poor growth (failure to thrive). The respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms are consistent with cystic fibrosis, which often leads to complications such as chronic lung disease and right heart failure (cor pulmonale), evident by the loud S2, jugular venous distention, and peripheral edema.

2. **Congenital Heart Disease (specifically, a form that can present with right heart failure)**: The presence of pitting edema, jugular venous distention, hepatomegaly, and a loud S2 may indicate right-sided heart failure. While congenital heart disease can present early in life, less severe forms might present in adolescence with signs of heart failure.

3. **Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (Kartagener Syndrome)**: This disorder presents with recurrent respiratory infections due to defective ciliary function, leading to bronchiectasis. It can also present with situs abnormalities (like situs inversus) and chronic sinusitis, which aligns with his chronic nasal congestion. The gastrointestinal symptoms are less typical, making this a less likely but possible diagnosis.",Cystic fibrosis,accurate
9,"A 30-year-old woman presents to her physician for difficulty breathing. She states that this typically happens to her when she goes outside and improves with rest and staying indoors. Her symptoms are currently worse than usual. The patient has never seen a physician before and has no diagnosed past medical history. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 97/58 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 25/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Pulmonary function tests demonstrate a decreased inspiratory and expiratory flow rate. Which of the following is the best initial treatment for this patient?","1. **Inhaled bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol)** - Given the acute presentation of dyspnea with signs of airflow obstruction (decreased inspiratory and expiratory flow rate) and improvement with rest and staying indoors, the most likely diagnosis is asthma. An inhaled bronchodilator like albuterol is the standard initial treatment for acute asthma exacerbations.

2. **Supplemental oxygen** - With an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, this patient is hypoxemic. Administering supplemental oxygen is crucial to improve her oxygen saturation and alleviate symptoms of hypoxia.

3. **Systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone)** - In the setting of acute exacerbation of asthma, systemic corticosteroids are often used to rapidly reduce inflammation and improve lung function, particularly if symptoms are severe or not adequately controlled with bronchodilators alone.",Epinephrine,Inaccurate
10,A 69-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of headache and worsening vision. Ophthalmologic examination shows a visual acuity of 20/120 in the right eye and 20/80 in the left eye. Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin of 14.2 g/dL and total serum calcium of 9.9 mg/dL. A photomicrograph of a peripheral blood smear is shown. Serum electrophoresis shows increased concentration of a pentameric immunoglobulin. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,"1. **Waldenström Macroglobulinemia** - This is characterized by the proliferation of lymphoplasmacytic cells that produce increased amounts of IgM, a pentameric immunoglobulin. Symptoms can include headache, vision problems, and abnormalities in laboratory findings as described.

2. **Multiple Myeloma** - This is a plasma cell disorder that can also present with symptoms such as headache and visual disturbances. However, it typically involves IgG or IgA monoclonal proteins rather than a pentameric immunoglobulin like IgM.

3. **Primary Amyloidosis** - This condition is characterized by the deposition of amyloid proteins in various tissues and can present with a wide range of symptoms, including neuropathy and visual disturbances. Serum electrophoresis may show monoclonal immunoglobulins, but it is less specific for pentameric IgM compared to Waldenström Macroglobulinemia.",Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia,accurate
11,"A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of upper abdominal pain that occurs immediately after eating. The pain is sharp, localized to the epigastrium, and does not radiate. He reports that he has been eating less frequently to avoid the pain and has had a 4-kg (8.8-lb) weight loss during this time. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years and drinks 3 beers daily. His vital signs are within normal limits. He is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 76.6 kg (169 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2. Physical examination shows mild upper abdominal tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory studies are within the reference range. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following conditions?","1. **Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD)** - The patient's symptoms of sharp, localized epigastric pain that occurs after eating, along with his history of smoking and alcohol consumption, suggest peptic ulcer disease. Smoking and alcohol are known risk factors for PUD, and the weight loss could be due to decreased food intake to avoid the pain.

2. **Gastritis** - Inflammation of the stomach lining, often caused by factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and stress, could explain the epigastric pain after eating. However, the absence of more systemic symptoms makes this less likely than PUD.

3. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)** - Although GERD usually causes a burning sensation rather than a sharp pain, it can present with epigastric discomfort that worsens with eating. Smoking and alcohol are also risk factors for GERD. However, the patient's symptom profile aligns more closely with PUD.",Gastrointestinal hemorrhage,inaccurate
12,"A 10-month-old boy is brought to the clinic with a history of recurrent episodes of stridor and wheezing. His mother reports that his wheezing is exacerbated by crying, feeding, and flexion of the neck, and is relieved by extension of the neck. Occasionally he vomits after feeding. What is the most likely diagnosis?","1. **Vascular Ring**: This congenital anomaly involves abnormal formation of the aortic arch, which can encircle and compress the trachea and esophagus, resulting in stridor, wheezing, and feeding difficulties. The symptoms worsening with neck flexion and improving with extension are typical for this condition.

2. **Laryngomalacia**: This is the most common cause of chronic stridor in infants, caused by a congenital softening of the tissues of the larynx above the vocal cords. The stridor typically worsens when the infant is supine, agitated, crying, or feeding.

3. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: GERD can cause recurrent wheezing and vomiting in infants due to acid reflux irritating the airways and esophagus. The association of wheezing with feeding and vomiting fits this diagnosis, though it is less likely to explain the improvement of symptoms with neck extension.",Double aortic arch,accurate
13,"A 55-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of worsening shortness of breath on exertion and fatigue. She has type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and chronic kidney disease. Her mother was diagnosed with colon cancer at the age of 65 years. Her blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. Examination shows conjunctival pallor. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 88 μm3
Reticulocyte count 0.6 %
Serum
Ferritin 145 ng/mL
Creatinine 3.1 mg/dL
Calcium 8.8 mg/dL
A fecal occult blood test is pending. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?""","1. **Anemia of Chronic Disease**: Given the patient's chronic kidney disease, it is highly likely that her anemia is due to erythropoietin deficiency, which is a common cause of normocytic anemia in chronic illness. The normal ferritin level suggests that her iron stores are adequate, supporting this diagnosis.

2. **Hypertension-Related Cardiovascular Disease**: The combination of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and shortness of breath could indicate hypertensive heart disease or other cardiovascular complications exacerbating her symptoms. However, this does not directly explain her anemia.

3. **Chronic Kidney Disease Progression**: Worsening chronic kidney disease itself can lead to both anemia and symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue due to decreased renal function and the associated metabolic disturbances. However, the primary cause of her anemia in this context is still likely to be erythropoietin deficiency.",Decreased erythropoietin production,accurate
14,"A 10-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of fever and productive cough. He has had similar episodes sporadically in the past with frequent episodes of thick, discolored nasal discharge. Physical examination shows diffuse crackles and rhonchi. An x-ray of the chest is shown. The most likely cause of recurrent infections in this patient is a dysfunction of which of the following cell types?","1. *Ciliated epithelial cells* - These cells are responsible for moving mucus and trapped pathogens out of the respiratory tract. Dysfunction in ciliated epithelial cells can lead to conditions like Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (Kartagener Syndrome), which results in recurrent respiratory infections due to impaired mucociliary clearance.

2. *Neutrophils* - These are a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in fighting bacterial infections. A dysfunction in neutrophils can lead to chronic and recurrent infections, as seen in conditions like Chronic Granulomatous Disease.

3. *Macrophages* - These cells are crucial for phagocytosing and digesting pathogens. Dysfunctional macrophages can contribute to recurrent infections, as observed in diseases like Chediak-Higashi Syndrome or other lysosomal storage disorders.",Ciliated columnar cells,accurate
15,"A 12-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents due to severe shortness of breath that started 20 minutes ago. She has a history of asthma and her current treatment regime includes a beta-agonist inhaler as well as a medium-dose corticosteroid inhaler. Her mother tells the physician that her daughter was playing outside with her friends when she suddenly started experiencing difficulty breathing and used her inhaler without improvement. On examination, she is struggling to breathe and with subcostal and intercostal retractions. She is leaning forward, and gasping for air and refuses to lie down on the examination table. Her blood pressure is 130/92 mm Hg, the respirations are 27/min, the pulse is 110/min and O2 saturation is 87%. There is prominent expiratory wheezes in all lung fields. The patient is put on a nonrebreather mask with 100% oxygen. An arterial blood gas is collected and sent for analysis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?","1. **Administer continuous nebulized albuterol and ipratropium** - This is the most appropriate next step given the severity of her asthma exacerbation. Continuous nebulization provides a more effective and sustained bronchodilation, especially when initial inhaler use is inadequate.

2. **Administer intravenous corticosteroids** - Since the patient is not responding to her inhaled corticosteroids and beta-agonist, intravenous corticosteroids like methylprednisolone should be administered to reduce airway inflammation and improve airflow over the next few hours.

3. **Consider magnesium sulfate infusion** - If the patient does not respond adequately to the above measures, intravenous magnesium sulfate can be administered as it can act as a bronchodilator in severe, refractory asthma exacerbations.",Inhaled albuterol,Accurate
16,"A 38-year-old woman is referred to a cardiologist for evaluation of syncope. Over the past year she has experienced 2 syncopal events. The first event occurred while she was standing, and the second when she laid down on her side. She denies bowel or bladder incontinence during the episodes or palpitations. However, she reports the presence of a low-grade fever over the past 3 months and a recent visit to the emergency department for a transient ischemic attack. She has a history of intravenous drug use but reports not having used in over 5 years. Temperature is 100.0°F (37.8°C), pressure is 115/72 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 20/min and regular. A detailed neurologic examination reveals no focal deficits. Cardiac auscultation demonstrates a diastolic ""plop"" at the cardiac apex. Which of the following findings will most likely be demonstrated on transthoracic echocardiography?","1. *Left atrial myxoma*: A left atrial myxoma is the most likely finding. The presence of a diastolic ""plop"" combined with syncope, a low-grade fever, and a history of transient ischemic attack are suggestive of an atrial myxoma. Myxomas can cause embolic events and can intermittently obstruct blood flow, leading to syncope.

2. *Mitral valve prolapse*: Mitral valve prolapse could potentially present with similar auscultatory findings, such as a mid-systolic click followed by a late systolic murmur. However, it is less likely to account for all the symptoms, especially the diastolic ""plop"" and systemic findings like fever and embolic events.

3. *Infective endocarditis*: Considering her history of intravenous drug use and fever, endocarditis remains a possibility, though less likely in this specific presentation. Endocarditis would typically present with different auscultatory findings and might be accompanied by signs of valve destruction or regurgitation.",Left atrial pedunculated mass,accurate
17,"A 71-year-old man comes to the physician for routine health maintenance examination. He feels well. He has hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Current medications include metoprolol and pantoprazole. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. Temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure 135/87 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 43%

Segmented neutrophils 22%
Basophils 1%
Eosinophils 2%
Lymphocytes 74%
Monocytes 1%
Platelet count 190,000/mm3
Blood smear shows small, mature lymphocytes and several smudge cells. Immunophenotypic analysis with flow cytometry shows B-cells that express CD19, CD20 and CD23. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""","1. **Observation and monitoring** - Considering the laboratory results, particularly the high leukocyte count with a predominance of lymphocytes and the presence of smudge cells, the patient most likely has chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Since he is asymptomatic and feels well, the standard approach is to monitor the patient without immediate intervention. Regular follow-up with physical exams and periodic blood counts will help track disease progression.

2. **Flow cytometry and immunophenotyping** - Although flow cytometry has already been performed and indicates B-CLL (presence of CD19, CD20, and CD23), confirming these findings with a repeat or more detailed flow cytometry may provide additional diagnostic clarity or detect any emerging aberrant clones.

3. **Molecular testing for prognostic markers** - Testing for specific genetic mutations or markers, such as TP53 mutations or 17p deletions, could help in stratifying the patient's prognosis and guide future management. While this is not immediately necessary for an asymptomatic patient, it can provide valuable information for tailored monitoring and potential treatment considerations in the future.",Observation and follow-up,accurate
18,"A 30-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of weakness and fatigue for 2 days. She has also noticed that her urine is darker than usual. For the past week, she has had a persistent non-productive cough and low-grade fever. She has seasonal allergies. She drinks one to two glasses of wine on social occasions and does not smoke. Her temperature is 37.9°C (100.2°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 110/76 mm Hg. She has conjunctival pallor and scleral icterus.

LDH 1,251 U/L
Haptoglobin 5.8 mg/dL (N = 41–165)
An x-ray of the chest shows bilateral patchy infiltrates. A peripheral blood smear shows spherocytes. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""","1. **Direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test**: The patient's symptoms of hemolysis (fatigue, weakness, and dark urine), evidence of hemolysis on labs (elevated bilirubin, elevated LDH, low haptoglobin), and the finding of spherocytes on peripheral smear strongly suggest autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). A positive Direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test would confirm the diagnosis.

2. **Cold agglutinin titer**: If the Direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test is positive, further identification of the cold agglutinins could help specify the type of AIHA. Given the patient's recent upper respiratory symptoms, this might be relevant in cases of Mycoplasma pneumonia which can trigger cold agglutinin disease.

3. **Parvovirus B19 serology**: Although less likely, serology for Parvovirus B19 could be considered since parvovirus can sometimes cause a transient aplastic crisis, typically in patients with underlying hemolytic disorders. However, this is a secondary consideration compared to the more immediate diagnostic tests for AIHA.",Direct Coombs test,accurate
19,A 55-year-old woman comes to the physician with concerns about swelling and pain in her right breast. Physical examination shows erythema and prominent pitting of the hair follicles overlying the upper and lower outer quadrants of the right breast. There are no nipple changes or discharge. A core needle biopsy shows invasive carcinoma of the breast. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's skin findings?,"1. **Lymphatic Obstruction (Peau d'orange)**: The erythema and prominent pitting of the hair follicles suggest lymphatic obstruction, often described as peau d'orange (orange peel texture). This is a common presentation of inflammatory breast cancer where cancer cells block the lymph vessels.
   
2. **Tumor Invasion into Skin**: The skin changes can also be caused directly by the invasion of the breast carcinoma into the dermal lymphatics, leading to inflammation and changes in skin texture and appearance.

3. **Localized Dermatitis**: While less likely given the context of invasive carcinoma, localized dermatitis or infection such as mastitis could cause erythema and skin changes. However, this is not the primary explanation in the presence of confirmed cancer.",Obstruction of the lymphatic channels,accurate
20,"A scientist is studying a protein that is present on the plasma membrane of cells. He therefore purifies the protein in a lipid bilayer and subjects it to a number of conditions. His investigations show that the protein has the following properties:

1) It is able to change ion concentrations across the membrane without addition of ATP to the solution.

2) Its activity increases linearly with substrate concentration without any saturation even at mildly supraphysiologic conditions.

3) In some states the protein leads to an ion concentration change; whereas, it has no effect in other states.

4) Changing the electrical charge across the membrane does not affect whether the protein has activity.

5) Adding a small amount of an additional substance to the solution reliably increases the protein's activity.

These findings are consistent with a protein with which of the following functions?","1. **Ion Channel:** The protein’s ability to change ion concentrations across the membrane without ATP indicates it doesn't rely on energy input like ATPases do. The linear increase in activity with substrate concentration and the presence of states where it might be inactive suggest gating mechanisms typical of ion channels.

2. **Facilitated Diffusion Transporter:** The linear increase in activity with substrate concentration fits with facilitated diffusion transporters that do not get saturated under normal conditions. They allow ions to pass through the membrane down their concentration gradient without using ATP.

3. **Gated Ion Channel:** The ability to change ion concentrations in some states but not others, and the modulation of activity by an additional substance, suggests the participation of a gating mechanism or regulatory molecule. This points towards a gated ion channel that opens or closes in response to specific signals.

These answers align well with your provided information and suggest the protein is most likely an ion channel with gating properties, possibly influenced by ligands or other regulatory factors.",Mediating neuronal to muscle end plate communication,inaccurate
21,"A 68-year-old male with congestive heart failure recently had his medication regiment adjusted to better control his hypertension. Three weeks later, laboratory analysis shows his serum calcium and magnesium levels have both decreased. The diuretic used in this patient acts predominantly on which nephron segment:","1. **Thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle** - Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, act here and are known to cause significant fluid loss and also deplete electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. This could explain the patient's decreased serum calcium and magnesium levels.

2. **Distal convoluted tubule** - Thiazide diuretics act on this segment and primarily affect sodium and chloride reabsorption. Though they typically increase calcium reabsorption, they can contribute to magnesium loss, which may, in turn, marginally affect calcium balance.

3. **Distal part of the collecting duct** - Potassium-sparing diuretics, such as spironolactone, act here. While less likely to affect calcium and magnesium directly, spironolactone often leads to hyperkalemia rather than a loss of calcium and magnesium, making it less likely in this scenario.",Thick ascending loop of Henle,accurate
22,"A 34-year-old G2P1 female at 37 weeks of gestation presents to the clinic for complaints of right-hand numbness and pain for the past month. She reports that the pain is usually worse at night and that she would sometimes wake up in the middle of the night from the “pins and needles.” She denies fever, weakness, or weight changes but endorses paresthesia and pain. The patient also reports a fall on her right hand 2 weeks ago. A physical examination demonstrates mild sensory deficits at the first 3 digits of the right hand but no tenderness with palpation. Strength is intact throughout. Which of the following findings would further support the diagnosis of this patient’s condition?","1. **Positive Phalen's Maneuver** - If the patient experiences exacerbation of numbness and tingling in the first three digits (thumb, index, and middle fingers) when the wrists are flexed for 60 seconds, it would further support the diagnosis of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS).

2. **Positive Tinel's Sign** - Tapping over the median nerve at the wrist may provoke tingling or ""pins and needles"" sensation in the distribution of the median nerve (first three digits), further supporting the diagnosis of CTS.

3. **Nerve Conduction Study Abnormalities** - Electrophysiological tests (nerve conduction studies) that demonstrate a slowed median nerve conduction velocity at the wrist or delayed distal latencies would provide objective evidence supporting the diagnosis of CTS.",Tingling when the right wrist is percussed,accurate
23,"A 42-year-old man is brought in to the emergency department by his daughter. She reports that her father drank heavily for the last 16 years, but he stopped 4 days ago after he decided to quit drinking on his birthday. She also reports that he has been talking about seeing cats running in his room since this morning, although there were no cats. There is no history of any known medical problems or any other substance use. On physical examination, his temperature is 38.4ºC (101.2ºF), heart rate is 116/min, blood pressure is 160/94 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 22/min. He is severely agitated and is not oriented to his name, time, or place. On physical examination, profuse perspiration and tremors are present. Which of the following best describes the pathophysiologic mechanism underlying his condition?","1. **Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium (Delirium Tremens)**: The patient's symptoms—such as confusion, agitation, hallucinations (seeing cats), elevated vital signs (hypertension, tachycardia, fever), tremors, and diaphoresis—are characteristic of delirium tremens (DTs), the most severe form of alcohol withdrawal. This condition results from the sudden cessation of heavy, chronic alcohol use, leading to neurochemical imbalances. Specifically, chronic alcohol use enhances the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and inhibits the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate via NMDA receptors. Abrupt alcohol cessation leads to decreased GABAergic activity and unopposed NMDA receptor activity, causing CNS hyperexcitability which manifests as delirium tremens.

2. **Increased Sympathetic Nervous System Activity**: During alcohol withdrawal, the reduction in GABAergic tone and increase in glutamatergic activity result in an overall increase in sympathetic nervous system activity. This manifests as tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and diaphoresis. Prolonged heavy alcohol use suppresses sympathetic output through its CNS depressant effect, and when alcohol is abruptly discontinued, a rebound sympathetic hyperactivity occurs.

3. **Deficiency in Thiamine (Vitamin B1)**: Although the patient's acute symptoms are primarily due to alcohol withdrawal, chronic alcoholism often leads to nutritional deficiencies, with thiamine being notably deficient. Thiamine deficiency can lead to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which includes symptoms such as confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. While not the primary cause of this patient's current acute symptoms, thiamine deficiency could potentially exacerbate the neurological manifestations during alcohol withdrawal. Prompt thiamine supplementation is therefore part of the management in such cases.",Increased activity of NMDA receptors,Accurate
24,"A 2-week-old female newborn is brought to the physician for the evaluation of red eyes with discharge for 2 days. She was born at 39 weeks' gestation to a 22-year-old woman. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. The mother received irregular prenatal care during the second half of the pregnancy. The newborn weighed 3700 g (8 lb 2.5 oz) at birth, and no congenital anomalies were noted. She currently weighs 4000 g (8 lb 13 oz). Examination of the newborn shows pink skin. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is mucopurulent discharge in both eyes and mild eyelid swelling. Polymerase chain reaction assay of conjunctival scraping confirms the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","1. **Oral erythromycin**: This is the primary treatment for neonatal Chlamydial conjunctivitis, which is suspected given the mucopurulent discharge, mild eyelid swelling, and positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay from conjunctival scraping. Chlamydia trachomatis is a common cause of conjunctivitis in newborns, and oral erythromycin effectively treats this infection.

2. **Topical erythromycin ointment**: Although not as effective as oral erythromycin for systemic Chlamydial infection, topical erythromycin ointment can provide adjunctive local treatment for neonatal conjunctivitis. However, this is generally part of standard prophylaxis to prevent gonococcal infection at birth rather than a primary treatment for established Chlamydial conjunctivitis.

3. **Referral to ophthalmologist**: While oral antibiotics are the primary treatment, a referral to an ophthalmologist might be considered for comprehensive eye care and to rule out any potential complications from the conjunctivitis. However, it is not the immediate next step in management for treatment purposes.",Oral erythromycin administration,accurate
25,An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 1-day history of severe left hand pain. He has had similar painful episodes in the past that required hospitalization. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae. There is tenderness on palpation of the wrist and the small joints of the left hand. Peripheral blood smear shows crescent-shaped erythrocytes. He is started on a pharmacologic agent that is known to cause macrocytosis. This drug causes an arrest in which of the following cell cycle phases?,"The most plausible answers to the given question are:

1. **S phase** - The pharmacologic agent described is likely hydroxyurea, which is used in the treatment of sickle cell disease to increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production. Hydroxyurea causes DNA synthesis to be impaired, which arrests cells in the S phase.

2. **G1 phase** - Some drugs that also cause macrocytosis can affect the G1 phase by impacting the cell's ability to initiate DNA replication. However, this is less specific to the drug mentioned in the clinical context here.

3. **M phase** - There are agents that can cause macrocytosis which affect the mitotic spindle, leading to arrest in mitosis (M phase), though this is not typically associated with hydroxyurea.

Given the clinical context, S phase arrest is the most relevant answer.",S phase,accurate
26,"A 38-year-old man comes to the physician because of an 8-month history of upper abdominal pain. During this period, he has also had nausea, heartburn, and multiple episodes of diarrhea with no blood or mucus. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 18 years. He does not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Current medications include an antacid. The abdomen is soft and there is tenderness to palpation in the epigastric and umbilical areas. Upper endoscopy shows several ulcers in the duodenum and the upper jejunum as well as thick gastric folds. Gastric pH is < 2. Biopsies from the ulcers show no organisms. Which of the following tests is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?","1. **Serum gastrin level** - Measuring serum gastrin levels can help confirm the diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, a condition characterized by gastric acid hypersecretion leading to multiple ulcers and thickened gastric folds.

2. **Secretin stimulation test** - This test can be used to further confirm Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in cases where serum gastrin levels are elevated. It helps differentiate between gastrinomas (which cause ZES) and other causes of elevated gastrin.

3. **Chromogranin A level** - This is a marker for neuroendocrine tumors such as gastrinomas, and elevated levels can support the diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.",Fasting serum gastrin level,accurate

The vital signs are within normal limits for his age. The abdomen is distended, the anus is patent, and the rectal examination reveals pale mucous with non-pigmented meconium. Based on a barium enema, the boy is diagnosed with sigmoid colonic atresia. Disruption of which structure during fetal development could lead to this anomaly?","1. *Inferior mesenteric artery* - The inferior mesenteric artery supplies blood to the distal part of the large intestine, including the sigmoid colon. Disruption of this artery during fetal development can lead to ischemia and subsequent atresia of the sigmoid colon.

2. *Umbilical arteries* - Although umbilical arteries primarily supply blood to the placenta, abnormalities in the umbilical artery formation could affect fetal circulation. This might indirectly lead to insufficient blood flow to parts of the gastrointestinal tract, potentially causing atresia.

3. *Vitelline arteries* - These arteries contribute to the development and blood supply of the midgut, but their involvement in the blood supply can also extend to parts of the hindgut in early development stages. Disruption could potentially affect the sigmoid colon during crucial periods of colonic development.",Inferior mesenteric artery,accurate
28,"A 65-year-old woman presents with memory problems for the past few weeks. Patient vividly describes how she forgot where she put her car keys this morning and did not remember to wish her grandson a happy birthday last week. Patient denies any cognitive problems, bowel/bladder incontinence, tremors, gait problems, or focal neurologic signs. Patient mentions she wants to take Ginkgo because her friend told her that it can help improve her brain function and prevent memory loss. Past medical history is significant for an acute cardiac event several years ago. Current medications are aspirin, carvedilol, and captopril. Patient denies any history of smoking, alcohol or recreational drug use. Patient is a widow, lives alone, and is able to perform all activities of daily living (ADLs) easily. No significant family history. Patient is afebrile and vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following would be the most appropriate response to this patient’s request to take Ginkgo?","1. ""Ginkgo biloba is a supplement that some people use to try to improve memory and cognitive function. However, there is limited scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness for memory improvement, particularly in cases of memory loss similar to yours. Additionally, Ginkgo can increase the risk of bleeding, especially given that you are already taking aspirin, which also has a blood-thinning effect. I would recommend discussing safer, evidence-based options for managing and improving your memory.""

2. ""While Ginkgo biloba is a popular herbal remedy for cognitive enhancement, its effectiveness has not been conclusively proven in scientific studies. Since you have a history of cardiac events and are on medications like aspirin, which can interact with Ginkgo and increase bleeding risk, it would be wise to avoid it. We can explore other strategies to help with your memory problems, such as cognitive exercises or consulting a specialist.""

3. ""Ginkgo biloba is not without risks, especially for individuals on certain medications like aspirin, which can interact negatively and increase the likelihood of bleeding complications. Given your medical history and current treatment, it's important to prioritize safety. Perhaps a thorough evaluation of your memory problems by a neurologist or cognitive therapist might yield better-tailored and safer interventions.""","""No, taking ginkgo will increase your risk for bleeding.""",accurate
29,"A 49-year-old man presents to his primary care physician complaining of heartburn and mild epigastric pain after eating for the past 6 months. He reports that his symptoms occur within an hour of eating a meal and persist for approximately an hour. He admits his symptoms have been progressively worsening. He recently began having these symptoms when he lies in the supine position. He has tried eating smaller meals and avoiding spicy food to no avail. He denies vomiting, difficulty swallowing, recent weight loss, or changes in stool color. He does admit to having a ""sour"" taste in his mouth when symptomatic. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 149/82 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, respirations are 18/min, and BMI is 32 kg/m^2. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are auscultated in all quadrants. Laboratory results demonstrate the following:

Serum:
Hemoglobin: 13.5 g/dL
Hematocrit: 41%
Leukocyte count: 4,500/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 257,000/mm^3
Fecal occult blood test (FOBT): Negative

Which of the following is the next best step in management?","1. **Initiate proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy** - Considering the patient's symptoms of heartburn, epigastric pain, and a ""sour"" taste in his mouth (indicative of acid reflux), as well as the progressive worsening of symptoms particularly when lying supine, it is highly suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). A PPI can reduce stomach acid production, thereby alleviating symptoms.

2. **Obtain an upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy, EGD)** - If the patient does not respond adequately to initial PPI therapy or has any alarm features (which, in this case, he does not), an upper endoscopy may be indicated to assess for potential complications of GERD, such as erosive esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus.

3. **Lifestyle modifications and dietary counseling** - While the patient has already attempted some dietary changes, further detailed counseling on weight loss (given his BMI of 32 kg/m^2), dietary habits, and other lifestyle modifications like avoiding eating late at night, elevating the head of the bed, and identifying and avoiding other trigger foods can also be useful as a supplemental approach to PPI therapy.",Omeprazole,accurate
30,"A healthy 29-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. Her brother has a disease that has resulted in infertility, a right-sided heart, and frequent sinus and ear infections. No other family members are affected. The intended father has no history of this disease. The population prevalence of this disease is 1 in 40,000. Which of the following best represents the chance that this patient’s offspring will develop her brother's disease?","1. The most plausible answer is that the patient is a carrier of an autosomal recessive condition, like Kartagener syndrome (Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia), which typically involves situs inversus, respiratory infections, and infertility. Given that the condition is rare, with a prevalence of 1 in 40,000, and assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the carrier frequency (q) of the allele would be approximately 1/100. If the intended father is from the general population, he would also have a carrier frequency of roughly the same. The chance of both being carriers is 1/100 * 1/100 = 1/10,000, and for two carriers to have an affected child is 1/4. Therefore, the chance that the patient’s offspring will develop the disease is about 1/40,000.
 
2. Another plausible answer is that the disease might be inherited in a pattern associated with autosomal recessive inheritance. If we calculate this rigorously using the carrier probability and risk of transmission to offspring, the probability could be explained as follows. This includes calculating if both parents are carriers (1/10000) and then the chance of an affected child (1/4). Thus, combined, the risk would be 1 in 160,000.

3. A less likely but plausible scenario, though extensively less probable, is that the disease could demonstrate X-linked inheritance if greater male susceptibility is observed, especially given the symptoms of chronic infections which might suggest immune deficiencies. However, since the woman's brother has the condition and it is rare, this scenario is limited. Given this condition's compatibility with such genetic mechanisms seems less supportive of this inheritance.

31,"A drug research team has synthesized a novel oral drug that acts as an agonist at multiple adrenergic receptors. When administered in animals, it has been shown to produce urinary retention at therapeutic doses with the absence of other manifestations of adrenergic stimulation. The researchers are interested in understanding signal transduction and molecular mechanisms behind the action of the novel drug. Which of the following receptors would most likely transduce signals across the plasma membrane following the administration of this novel drug?","1. **α1-adrenergic receptor** - This receptor type primarily mediates smooth muscle contraction, which could lead to urinary retention by causing the sphincter muscles of the bladder to contract.

2. **β3-adrenergic receptor** - This receptor is known to be involved in the relaxation of the detrusor muscle in the bladder. Agonism here could imbalance normal detrusor function, contributing to urinary retention.

3. **α2-adrenergic receptor** - Although less directly involved in smooth muscle contraction, α2 receptors can influence urinary retention by reducing sympathetic outflow when activated, which helps manage overall adrenergic tone including effects on the bladder.",GqPCRs (Gq protein-coupled receptors),accurate

On physical examination, the fundal height is 25 centimeters. A fetal ultrasound shows a proportional reduction in head circumference, trunk size, and limb length. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient’s presentation?","1. Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) - This condition can result in a proportional reduction in head circumference, trunk size, and limb length. It can be due to various causes, including placental insufficiency, maternal hypertension, or infections.

2. Congenital Infection - Infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) or toxoplasmosis can lead to symmetrical growth restriction, presenting with reduced head circumference, trunk size, and limb length.

He has hypercholesterolemia and hypertension treated with atorvastatin and labetalol. He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 35 years. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a 4-cm (1.6-in), nontender, pulsatile mass with a palpable thrill at the right midinguinal point. On auscultation, a harsh continuous murmur is heard over the mass. Femoral and pedal pulses are palpable bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","1. Femoral artery aneurysm: This is a localized enlargement of the femoral artery that can present as a pulsatile mass in the groin. The presence of a thrill and a continuous murmur, along with the patient's history of smoking and hypercholesterolemia, supports this diagnosis.

2. Arteriovenous fistula: This abnormal connection between an artery and a vein can produce a palpable thrill and a continuous murmur due to turbulent blood flow between the high-pressure artery and the low-pressure vein. The pulsatile mass could correspond to the arterial component.

3. Inguinal hernia: Though less likely given the pulsatile nature of the mass, an inguinal hernia can sometimes present as a groin lump. It is less consistent with the presence of a thrill and continuous murmur, which are more indicative of vascular abnormalities.",Femoral artery aneurysm,accurate

The patient is given 3 liters of Lactated Ringer solution and his blood pressure improves to 110/70 mmHg and his pulse is 95/min. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","1. *Immediate abdominal and pelvic CT scan*: Given the sudden change in the patient's condition, along with back and flank pain, an abdominal and pelvic CT scan is critical to rule out retroperitoneal hemorrhage or other vascular complications, especially post-cardiac catheterization.

2. *Monitor vital signs and continuous cardiac telemetry*: This would help in closely observing any further hemodynamic instability or arrhythmias, particularly given the history of recent cardiac intervention and initial hypotensive episode.

3. *Check serum hemoglobin and hematocrit levels*: These tests will help assess whether there is ongoing significant blood loss that might be contributing to his symptoms and hypotension.",CT scan,accurate

His complete blood count (CBC) is significant for a hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 5.3 g/dL. The trauma surgery resident initiates the massive transfusion protocol and orders whole blood, O negative, which she explains is the universal donor. The patient receives 6 units of O negative blood prior to admission. He subsequently develops fever, chills, hematuria, and pulmonary edema. Several hours later, the patient goes into hemodynamic shock requiring the emergent administration of vasopressors. Of the following options, which hypersensitivity reaction occurred?","1. **Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR)** - This is the most plausible cause in the given scenario, characterized by fever, chills, hematuria, and pulmonary edema shortly after blood transfusion. The reaction happens when the transfused blood is incompatible with the recipient's type, leading to the destruction of red blood cells.

2. **Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)** - TRALI can present with acute respiratory distress and pulmonary edema after a transfusion, caused by the patient's immune system reacting to donor antibodies. However, hematuria is not typically a feature of TRALI, making it less likely here.

3. **Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR)** - This reaction is characterized by fever and chills occurring during or after a transfusion but generally does not cause hematuria or severe symptoms such as pulmonary edema or shock, making it a less likely but still possible cause.",Type 2 hypersensitivity reaction,relevant

On examination, the child appears sleepy but has a healthy cry during the exam. The child has dry mucous membranes and delayed capillary refill. There is a palpable olive-shaped epigastric mass on palpation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?","1. **Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis** - The presentation of projectile vomiting in a well-appearing infant, the palpable olive-shaped epigastric mass, and signs of dehydration (dry mucous membranes, delayed capillary refill) are classic findings of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. This condition typically presents in the first few weeks of life and is more common in firstborn infants.

2. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)** - While GERD can cause vomiting in infants, it is less likely to cause projectile vomiting and dehydration. It also typically does not present with a palpable mass on examination.

3. **Intestinal Malrotation with Midgut Volvulus** - This is a surgical emergency that can present with bilious vomiting and abdominal distension.

39,  An outbreak of diphtheria has occurred for the third time in a decade in a small village in South Africa. Diphtheria is endemic to the area with many healthy villagers colonized with different bacterial strains. Vaccine distribution in this area is difficult due to treacherous terrain. A team of doctors is sent to the region to conduct a health campaign. Toxigenic strains of C. diphtheria are isolated from symptomatic patients. Which of the following best explains the initial emergence of a pathogenic strain causing such outbreaks?,"1. Horizontal Gene Transfer: The initial emergence of a pathogenic strain of C. diphtheriae could be explained by the acquisition of tox genes, which encode diphtheria toxin, through horizontal gene transfer. This process can occur via bacteriophages (phage conversion) that transfer tox genes between bacterial strains, allowing previously non-toxigenic strains to become toxigenic and pathogenic.

2. Environmental and Socioeconomic Factors: The village’s challenging terrain and limited access to healthcare and vaccinations could contribute to suboptimal vaccination coverage, creating an environment where the pathogen can thrive and spread. Lack of herd immunity allows virulent strains to cause periodic outbreaks, as seen with the repeated occurrence of diphtheria in the region.

3. Colonization and Carriage: Many healthy villagers being colonized with different bacterial strains indicates a reservoir of C. diphtheriae present in the community. Changes in host immune status, environmental conditions, or mutations that enhance virulence could result in the emergence of a pathogenic strain from these colonized populations, leading to outbreaks.",Lysogenic conversion,Relevant

The physician performs a complete physical examination and orders laboratory tests. Which of the following findings is most likely to be present on his physical examination or laboratory studies?","1. **Hypokalemia** - Oral beta-agonists like albuterol can lead to transient drops in potassium levels, especially when taken in excessive doses. Symptoms to look for include muscle weakness or cramps, along with laboratory confirmation of decreased potassium.

2. **Tachycardia** - Overuse of beta-agonists, whether inhaled or oral, can stimulate β2-receptors in the heart, leading to increased heart rate. This can be detected during the physical examination by measuring his heart rate.

3. **Elevated Blood Glucose** - Albuterol, as a beta-agonist, can increase glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. This can be confirmed with laboratory blood tests.",Pulse rate is 116/min,accurate

A transesophageal echocardiogram reveals a small mobile mass on the aortic valve with moderate aortic insufficiency. A colonoscopy is obtained with a small bowel biopsy. A periodic acid-Schiff stain is positive for foamy macrophages. Which of the following is the best next step in management?","1. **Intravenous Antibiotic Therapy** - The symptoms and diagnostic findings suggest Whipple's disease, a rare bacterial infection caused by Tropheryma whipplei. The presence of foamy macrophages with periodic acid-Schiff positivity in the small bowel biopsy and the involvement of multiple systems (i.e., gastrointestinal, central nervous system, and cardiovascular) are indicative. Immediate treatment with antibiotics is essential to manage and prevent progression of the disease.

2. **Consult Infectious Disease Specialist** - Given the complexity and rarity of Whipple's disease, consulting an infectious disease specialist can help to confirm the diagnosis, tailor the antibiotic regimen, monitor for treatment response, and manage potential complications.

3. **Follow-Up Echocardiography and Cardiology Referral** - Given the new finding of a systolic ejection murmur and aortic valve involvement, a follow-up echocardiogram and cardiology referral are important to monitor the heart condition, assess the severity of valve involvement, and determine if surgical intervention might be necessary in the future.",Ceftriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,inaccurate

What is the appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis?","1. **Administer Tetanus Immunoglobulin (TIG) and the Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis (Tdap) vaccine:** Given the patient's unclear vaccination history and the nature of the injury (deep and potentially contaminated with rusted metal), administration of TIG provides immediate passive immunity, while Tdap initiates active immunity.

2. **Administer the Tetanus and Diphtheria (Td) booster:** If Tdap is unavailable, administration of Td is an alternative to initiate active immunity against tetanus and diphtheria. TIG should still be given due to the high risk of tetanus from the contaminated wound and the patient's uncertain vaccination history.

3. **Administer antibiotics to cover for wound infection:** Given the soiled and rusted nature of the metal, the patient is at risk of bacterial infection, including tetanus and other bacterial pathogens. Empirical antibiotic coverage (e.g., broad-spectrum antibiotics) may be considered to prevent wound infection alongside tetanus prophylaxis.

44,"A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 12-week history of persistent cough. The cough is nonproductive and worse at night. She otherwise feels well. She has not had any changes in appetite or exercise tolerance. For the past year, she has smoked an occasional cigarette at social occasions. Use of herbal cough medications has not provided any symptom relief. She has no history of serious illness but reports getting a runny nose every morning during winter. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 110/76 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination and an x-ray of the chest show no abnormalities. Her FEV1 is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","1. **Evaluate for Upper Airway Cough Syndrome (UACS):** Given the patient's history of a persistent nonproductive cough that is worse at night and a runny nose every morning during winter, it is plausible that postnasal drip due to allergic rhinitis or other nasal conditions could be causing her symptoms. A trial of an antihistamine or decongestant may be warranted to see if it alleviates her cough.

2. **Consider Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):** Even though the patient has not reported typical GERD symptoms, GERD can present solely as a chronic cough. A trial of a proton pump inhibitor or lifestyle modifications to reduce reflux might be beneficial to see if her symptoms improve.

3. **Assess for Asthma:** Despite a normal FEV1, the patient’s cough being worse at night and having no other significant symptoms suggests the possibility of variant asthma. A methacholine challenge test or trial of an inhaled corticosteroid could help determine if asthma is the underlying cause of her symptoms.",Oral diphenhydramine,relevant
45,"A 72-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department with dyspnea for 2 days. She is on regular hemodialysis at 3 sessions a week but missed her last session due to an unexpected trip. She has a history of congestive heart failure. After urgent hemodialysis, the patient’s dyspnea does not improve as expected. The cardiologist is consulted. After evaluation of the patient, he notes in the patient’s electronic record: “the patient does not have a chronic heart condition and a cardiac cause of dyspnea is unlikely.” The following morning, the nurse finds the cardiologist’s notes about the patient not having congestive heart failure odd. The patient had a clear history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%. After further investigation, the nurse realizes that the cardiologist evaluated the patient’s roommate. She is an elderly woman with a similar first name. She is also on chronic hemodialysis. To prevent similar future errors, the most appropriate strategy is to use which of the following?","1. Use of two patient identifiers (e.g., name and date of birth) during patient interactions to ensure the correct patient is being evaluated or treated.
2. Implementing bar-coded patient identification bands that are scanned before any patient interaction, medication administration, or treatment to ensure the correct patient is being addressed.
3. Establishing a standardized patient room assignment system that includes clear and distinct labeling of patient rooms and beds to prevent mix-ups, especially in shared rooms.",Two patient identifiers at every patient encounter by any healthcare provider,accurate
46,"A 46-year-old female is brought to the emergency department by her husband 1 hour after the onset of chest palpitations. Her symptoms began suddenly while she was drinking coffee and have persisted since then. She has not had shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or loss of consciousness. She has experienced these palpitations before, but they typically resolve spontaneously within a few minutes. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 155/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Physical examination shows no abnormalities other than tachycardia. An ECG is shown. Repeated, forceful exhalation against a closed glottis while supine fails to relieve her symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","1. **Administration of intravenous adenosine**: Given the sudden onset of palpitations and the fact that the attempt at vagal maneuvers (e.g., Valsalva maneuver) has not relieved her symptoms, the most appropriate next step is likely the administration of intravenous adenosine. Adenosine is commonly used to terminate supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which is suggested by the clinical presentation and ECG findings.

2. **Administration of intravenous beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers**: If adenosine is not available or contraindicated, the next best step would be the administration of intravenous beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) or calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem or verapamil). These medications can help to control the heart rate by slowing down the conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node.

3. **Synchronized cardioversion**: If the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable (e.g., develops hypotension, chest pain, altered mental status) or if medication is ineffective, synchronized cardioversion would be the next step in management. This procedure delivers a controlled electric shock to restore normal heart rhythm.",Administer adenosine intravenously,accurate
47,A 61-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of epigastric pain and a 9-kg (20-lb) weight loss. He feels full and bloated even after eating small portions of food. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.5 g/dL with a mean corpuscular volume of 78 μm3. Test of the stool for occult blood is positive. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy shows a 2-cm raised lesion with central ulceration on the lesser curvature of the stomach. Histologic examination of a gastric biopsy specimen from the lesion is most likely to show which of the following?,"1. Adenocarcinoma - The most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and findings (epigastric pain, significant weight loss, positive stool occult blood, and a raised lesion with central ulceration) is gastric adenocarcinoma. Histologic examination would show malignant glandular cells.

2. Gastric lymphoma - Another possibility is a primary gastric lymphoma. Although less common than adenocarcinoma, gastric lymphomas can present with similar symptoms and endoscopic findings. Histologic examination would reveal lymphoid tissue, often with large atypical lymphocytes.

3. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) - This is another type of tumor that can occur in the stomach and present with similar symptoms and endoscopic findings. Histologic examination would show spindle cells or epithelioid cells, and immunohistochemical staining for c-KIT (CD117) would typically be positive.",Gland-forming cuboidal cells,accurate
48,"A 28-year-old woman is brought to a counselor by her father after he found out that she is being physically abused by her husband. The father reports that she refuses to end the relationship with her husband despite the physical abuse. She says that she feels uneasy when her husband is not around. She adds, “I'm worried that if I leave him, my life will only get worse.” She has never been employed since they got married because she is convinced that nobody would hire her. Her husband takes care of most household errands and pays all of the bills. Physical examination shows several bruises on the thighs and back. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","1. *Dependent Personality Disorder (DPD)* - The woman exhibits extreme dependence on her husband, feels helpless without him, and fears that her life will worsen if she leaves him. These symptoms align well with DPD, where individuals often have difficulty making everyday decisions without excessive advice and reassurance from others.

2. *Battered Woman Syndrome (BWS)* - This is a specific subtype of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The prolonged and severe abuse may lead her to believe that leaving the abuser will not improve her circumstances and may actually make them worse. The presence of physical abuse and her reluctance to leave the abuser fits this diagnosis.

3. *Learned Helplessness* - This is a psychological condition in which a person has learned to believe that they are helpless in a particular situation, typically due to repeated failures or abuse. This can lead to a mindset where they feel unable to improve their situation or see any positive outcome from leaving the abusive environment.",Dependent personality disorder,accurate
49,"A 66-year-old homeless HIV-positive male presents with numbness in his hands and feet. The patient says that his symptoms started gradually a couple weeks ago and have slowly worsened. He describes numbness initially in just his fingertips and toes but it has now spread to involve his entire hands and feet. Past medical history is significant for HIV diagnosed many years ago, for which the patient has never sought treatment. The patient also has a long history of various illnesses, especially chronic diarrhea, but he is unable to remember any details. He currently takes no medications. The patient has been homeless for years, and he denies any alcohol or drug use. Review of systems is significant for a sore tongue. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure is 100/65 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, respiratory rate is 25/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. On physical exam, the patient is alert and oriented, his body habitus is cachectic, and his BMI is 17 kg/m2. His tongue appears erythematous and smooth with loss of papillae, but no lesions or evidence of infection is noted. Cardiac exam is normal apart from tachycardia. Lungs are clear to auscultation. His abdomen is soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly. There is decreased 2-point discrimination in the hands and feet bilaterally. Strength in the hands and feet is 4/5 bilaterally. Reflexes are absent in the ankles. Gait is slightly wide-based and ataxic, and there is a positive Romberg sign. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?","1. **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: Given the patient's symptoms of numbness in hands and feet, gait ataxia, positive Romberg sign, and a sore, erythematous, smooth tongue, vitamin B12 deficiency is the most likely diagnosis. This deficiency can lead to subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord and peripheral neuropathy, which would explain both the sensory and motor deficits observed.

2. **HIV-associated neuropathy**: HIV can directly cause peripheral neuropathy, particularly in patients who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy. This could present with distal symmetric polyneuropathy, typically causing numbness and tingling that often begins in the feet and can progress to the hands.

3. **Nutritional deficiency (other than Vitamin B12)**: Given the patient’s cachectic state and history of chronic diarrhea, other nutritional deficiencies such as folate deficiency, vitamin E deficiency, or thiamine (B1) deficiency could also contribute to neuropathy and other neurological symptoms. His poor nutritional status could be causing multiple deficiencies that together lead to the observed clinical picture.",Elevated levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA),relevant
