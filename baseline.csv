Although he is on antiretroviral medications, he admits that he is noncompliant. On examination, the patient is cachectic with pale conjunctiva. On lab evaluation, the patient’s CD4+ count is 70/mm3. What is the most likely cause of his symptoms?","1. Esophageal candidiasis: Given the patient's history of HIV and low CD4+ count along with symptoms of difficulty swallowing and bad breath, esophageal candidiasis is a common opportunistic infection seen in HIV-positive individuals. The presence of oral thrush may also suggest a fungal infection.

2. Esophageal ulcers: In HIV-positive patients with low CD4+ counts, esophageal ulcers can occur as a result of opportunistic infections or malignancies. The symptoms of difficulty swallowing and the sensation of something being stuck in the throat can be seen in patients with esophageal ulcers.

3. Esophageal stricture: Chronic untreated esophageal candidiasis or other infections can lead to scarring and narrowing of the esophagus, resulting in difficulty swallowing. In this patient with a low CD4+ count and likely esophageal symptoms, esophageal stricture should also be considered.",Candida albicans,Relevant.

She says: “I can describe how the aliens chase me except for my car which is parked in the garage. You know, the sky is beautiful today. Why does my mother have a cat?” Which of the following best describes this patient's thought process?","*1* 1. Loose associations: This patient's thought process is characterized by loose associations, where her thoughts lack logical coherence and easily jump from one unrelated topic to another. This is evident in her response to the examiner's question, where she shifts from describing aliens chasing her to the beauty of the sky and her mother's cat.

*2* 2. Flight of ideas: Flight of ideas is a rapid shifting of thoughts from one idea to another, often based on discernible links between the topics. While the patient in this case does exhibit disorganized and rapid speech, her thoughts do not appear to follow a typical pattern or connected logic, which is more characteristic of loose associations than flight of ideas.

*3* 3. Tangentiality: Tangentiality refers to a thought process where the individual goes off on tangents and never returns to the main point. While this patient's speech does include some tangential elements, her overall thought process is better described by the presence of loose associations, where the lack of logical coherence is more prominent.",Loose associations,Relevant

An echocardiogram in this patient would most likely reveal which of the following?","*1*  *Pulmonary hypertension*: Given the patient's history of osteosarcoma with pulmonary metastases as a child and the current presentation of progressively worsening shortness of breath and occasional chest pain, pulmonary hypertension is a likely consideration. The loud P2 sound on physical exam is suggestive of increased pressure in the pulmonary artery.

*2*  *Right ventricular hypertrophy*: Pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular hypertrophy as the right ventricle works harder to pump blood against the increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation. This could be seen on an echocardiogram in this patient.

Which of the following medications was this patient most likely prescribed for his depression?","1. *1* Amitriptyline: Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is known to have anticholinergic side effects, including urinary retention, constipation, and dry mouth. These symptoms suggest that the patient may be experiencing anticholinergic toxicity due to amitriptyline.

2. *2* Imipramine: Similar to amitriptyline, imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant with anticholinergic properties. It can also cause urinary retention, constipation, and dry mouth.

3. *3* Paroxetine: Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly used to treat depression. While SSRIs can have side effects, they are less likely to cause urinary retention compared to tricyclic antidepressants.",Amitriptyline,Relevant

*3* 3. **Close monitoring and oxygen therapy**: While oxygen therapy is important in this patient, the immediate priority is decompression of the tension pneumothorax. Monitoring the patient closely for any signs of deterioration is important, but the main intervention should be decompression followed by chest tube placement.",Chest tube insertion,Relevant.
