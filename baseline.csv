2,"A 41-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for asthma and seasonal allergies presents with a new rash. She has no significant past surgical, social, or family history. The patient's blood pressure is 131/90 mm Hg, the pulse is 77/min, the respiratory rate is 17/min, and the temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F). Physical examination reveals a sharply demarcated area of skin dryness and erythema encircling her left wrist. Review of systems is otherwise negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","*1*  Contact dermatitis: Given the sharply demarcated area of skin dryness and erythema encircling her left wrist, contact dermatitis is the most likely diagnosis. Contact dermatitis can present as a localized red, itchy rash that occurs when the skin comes into contact with an irritant or allergen. In this case, the patient's history of seasonal allergies and asthma raises suspicion for an allergic reaction.

*2*  Allergic reaction: Considering the patient's history of asthma and seasonal allergies, an allergic reaction is another plausible diagnosis. Allergic reactions can manifest as skin rashes, hives, itching, and redness, particularly when exposed to an allergen that triggers an immune response.

*3*  Atopic dermatitis (eczema): While atopic dermatitis (eczema) could be considered, the description of a sharply demarcated area of skin dryness and erythema encircling her left wrist is more characteristic of contact dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis typically presents as a more diffuse, scaly rash that can occur on multiple areas of the body.",Contact dermatitis,Relevant

Hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL
Leukocytes 14,000/mm3
Platelets 155,000/mm3
ESR     40 mm/hr
What is the best next step in the management of this patient?","*1* The best next step in the management of this patient would be to perform a diagnostic joint aspiration of the left knee. This procedure involves removing fluid from the knee joint for analysis, which can help determine the underlying cause of the knee pain and swelling. In this case, the patient's presentation with a swollen, warm, and tender knee with decreased range of movement suggests an inflammatory joint condition such as septic arthritis or crystal-induced arthritis, which can be confirmed or ruled out by analyzing the joint fluid.

*2* Order a synovial fluid analysis to evaluate for infection or crystal-induced arthritis. The synovial fluid analysis can provide important information about the inflammatory markers, cell count, and presence of crystals or bacteria in the joint fluid, helping to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious causes of arthritis.

*3* Consider starting empirical antibiotics while awaiting the synovial fluid analysis results. Given the patient's medical history and presentation, there is a concern for septic arthritis, especially with the elevated ESR and leukocytosis. Starting antibiotics early can help prevent complications from a potential joint infection while waiting for the definitive diagnosis from the synovial fluid analysis.",Synovial fluid analysis,Accurate.

The patient is responsive but lethargic. The patient is diaphoretic and extremities are pale and cool. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac sounds are diminished. Abdominal examination shows a visible bullet entry wound in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) with no corresponding exit wound on the flanks or back. The abdomen is distended and diffusely tender with a rebound. Aspiration of the nasogastric tube reveals bloody contents. Rectal examination shows no blood. Stool guaiac is negative. Which of the following is the next best step in management?","*1*  
1. **Emergent exploratory laparotomy**: Given the patient's presentation with signs of peritonitis (diffuse abdominal tenderness, rebound tenderness, bloody NG aspirate), clinical instability (hypotension, tachycardia), and the presence of a gunshot wound to the abdomen, an emergent exploratory laparotomy is the next best step in management. This would allow for direct visualization of any intra-abdominal injuries that may require immediate surgical intervention to control bleeding, repair organ damage, or prevent infection.

2. **Blood transfusion**: While the patient may require blood transfusion due to ongoing bleeding internally, addressing the source of bleeding through an exploratory laparotomy takes precedence in this emergent situation.

3. **Obtain a CT scan of the abdomen**: While a CT scan can provide valuable information about the extent of intra-abdominal injuries, the patient's unstable condition warrants prompt surgical intervention to address potential life-threatening injuries. A CT scan may be considered after stabilization or in cases where the diagnosis is unclear.",Exploratory laparotomy,Relevant.
10,"A 24-year-old primigravid woman at 38 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit.

Repeat ultrasound today shows a persistent breech presentation. The patient states that she would like to attempt a vaginal delivery. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?","*1* 
1. Offer external cephalic version (ECV) - ECV is the recommended first step in management for a breech presentation in a pregnant woman at 37 weeks or more gestation. ECV is a procedure where the healthcare provider tries to manually rotate the baby into a head-down position by applying pressure on the mother's abdomen. Success rates for ECV can range from 30% to 70%.

2. Schedule a cesarean delivery - If ECV is unsuccessful, a scheduled cesarean delivery would be the next step in management. A cesarean delivery is often recommended for breech presentations to reduce the risk of complications during delivery.

3. Offer a trial of labor - While a trial of labor for a breech presentation can be considered in certain circumstances, it is generally not recommended with a preterm gestation or in a primigravid patient. With a persistent breech presentation at 38 weeks, the risks of a trial of labor may outweigh the benefits, making it a less favorable option in this scenario.",Offer external cephalic version,Accurate
