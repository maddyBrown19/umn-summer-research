2,"Background:
Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients who have heart failure reduced ejection fraction and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.
Methods:
In a multicenter, double-blind, and randomized parallel group trial, we assigned 1,511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) and 1,518 to metoprolol (metoprolol tartrate, target dose 50 mg twice daily). Patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), previous admission for a cardiovascular reason, an ejection fraction of less than 0.35, and have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. The analysis was done by intention to treat.
Findings:
The mean study duration was 58 months (SD 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (0.07), and the mean age 62 years (11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1,511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1,518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p=0.0017). The reduction of all-cause mortality was consistent across predefined subgroups. The incidence of side effects and drug withdrawals did not differ by much between the two study groups.

12,"A 45-year-old female is undergoing renal transplantation for management of chronic renal failure secondary to glomerulonephritis. The transplant surgeon placed the donor kidney in the recipient and anastamosed the donor renal artery to the recipient's external iliac artery as well as the donor ureter to the recipient's bladder. After removing the clamps on the external iliac artery, the recipient's blood is allowed to perfuse the transplanted kidney. Within 3 minutes, the surgeon notes that the kidney does not appear to be sufficiently perfused. Upon further investigation, an inflammatory reaction is noted that led to clotting off of the donor renal artery, preventing blood flow to the transplanted organ. Which of the following best describes the pathophysiology of this complication?","*1* 1. Ischemia-reperfusion injury: This complication describes a phenomenon in which a period of reduced blood supply to an organ followed by reperfusion leads to tissue damage. Ischemia-reperfusion injury can lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, and ultimately, tissue damage. In this case, the temporary occlusion of the donor renal artery followed by reperfusion triggered an inflammatory reaction leading to clot formation and subsequent lack of perfusion to the transplanted kidney.

*2* 2. Thrombosis: The formation of a blood clot within the blood vessels leading to occlusion can be due to various factors such as endothelial injury, turbulent blood flow, or abnormalities in the coagulation cascade. In this scenario, the inflammatory reaction caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury could have triggered thrombosis in the donor renal artery, leading to the lack of blood flow to the transplanted kidney.

*3* 3. Acute tubular necrosis: Acute tubular necrosis is a condition characterized by damage to the renal tubules of the kidney, often as a result of ischemia or exposure to nephrotoxic substances. While acute tubular necrosis can occur as a consequence of ischemia-reperfusion injury, in this case, the primary cause of the insufficient perfusion of the transplanted kidney was the clotting off of the donor renal artery rather than direct tubular damage.",Type II hypersensitivity reaction,Inaccurate.

18,"An investigator is conducting a phase 1 trial for a novel epoxide reductase inhibitor with favorable pharmacokinetic properties for cerebrovascular accident prophylaxis. Two days after the trial starts, a subject begins to notice pain and erythema over the right thigh. It rapidly progresses to a purpuric rash with the development of necrotic bullae over the next 24 hours. Laboratory studies show a partial thromboplastin time of 29 seconds, prothrombin time of 28 seconds, and INR of 2.15. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of the disease process in the patient?","*1* The patient is likely experiencing warfarin-induced skin necrosis, which typically presents with painful erythema, followed by purpuric rash and necrotic bullae. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) leading to a procoagulant state with initially decreased levels of proteins C and S, which can result in skin necrosis. The laboratory values with an elevated INR and normal or mildly prolonged aPTT (indicating an effect on the extrinsic pathway) are consistent with warfarin-induced coagulopathy.

*2* Differential diagnoses for this condition could include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). While HIT can present with skin necrosis, the acute onset and purpuric rash with bullae are more consistent with warfarin-induced skin necrosis. DIC typically presents with both bleeding and clotting manifestations simultaneously and usually is not limited to one limb.

*3* Other potential causes of skin necrosis and purpura could include vasculitis or calciphylaxis. However, the rapid onset of symptoms, laboratory findings, and the patient's history of recent warfarin use make warfarin-induced skin necrosis a more likely diagnosis in this case.",Increased factor VIII activity,Relevant

They work by enhancing the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain, thereby reducing seizure activity.

*2* 2. **Phenytoin (Dilantin)**: Phenytoin is commonly used for long-term management of seizures, but it has a slower onset of action and is not typically used as the initial treatment for prolonged seizures in the emergency setting.

*3* 3. **Levetiracetam (Keppra)**: While levetiracetam is another antiepileptic drug commonly used for seizure management, it also has a slower onset of action compared to benzodiazepines and may not be the best choice for rapidly controlling prolonged seizures in the emergency department.",Lorazepam,Accurate.

Cardiac examination reveals a high-pitched scratching that obscures both heart sounds. The remainder of the examination is otherwise unremarkable. Cardiac enzyme levels and anti-DNA antibodies are within normal limits. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows Q waves in the anterior leads. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?","*1* 1. *Pericarditis*: Given the patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus and missed dialysis appointments, pericarditis is the most likely cause of her chest pain. The high-pitched scratching sound on cardiac examination (pericardial friction rub) and the relief of pain with sitting upright (assuming this is pericardial pain) are classic findings in pericarditis. The recent myocardial infarction raises the suspicion for Dressler syndrome (post-myocardial infarction pericarditis).

2. *Myocardial Infarction*: The previous history of myocardial infarction, as evidenced by the Q waves on ECG, makes myocardial infarction a possible cause of the patient's symptoms. However, pericarditis is more likely given the absence of significant ST segment changes and the high-pitched scratching sound on cardiac examination.

3. *Pulmonary Embolism*: While pulmonary embolism can present with chest pain, shortness of breath, and tachycardia, the findings such as high-pitched scratching on cardiac exam are more suggestive of pericarditis. Additionally, the absence of respiratory symptoms on examination and normal breath sounds make pulmonary embolism less likely.",Elevated serum levels of nitrogenous waste,Relevant
