0,"An individual presents to the emergency room complaining of headaches and palpitations. They report that the symptoms initially started several months prior but were attributed to stress at work. The symptoms occur episodically. Their family history is notable for medullary thyroid cancer and hyperparathyroidism. Their temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 165/90 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On examination, they appear tremulous. Urine metanephrines are elevated. Which of the following is the most appropriate first medication in the management of this individual’s condition?","1. Alpha-blockers (e.g., phenoxybenzamine) - These medications are the first-line treatment to manage hypertension and symptoms in patients with pheochromocytoma, which is strongly suggested by the elevated urine metanephrines and symptoms described.

2. Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) - After adequate alpha-blockade is achieved, beta-blockers can be introduced to manage tachycardia. They should never be administered before alpha-blockers as this can worsen hypertension.

3. Calcium channel blockers (e.g., nifedipine) - These can be used if there are contraindications to alpha-blockers or in addition if necessary to achieve better blood pressure control.",Phenoxybenzamine,relevant
1,"An individual comes to the physician for the evaluation of a skin rash over their shoulders and elbows for the past 5 days. The patient reports severe itching and a burning sensation. They have no history of serious illness except for recurrent episodes of diarrhea and abdominal cramps, which have occurred intermittently over the past three months. They describe their stools as greasy and foul-smelling. The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol. They do not take illicit drugs and are not on any medications. The individual is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 60 kg (132 lb); BMI is 18.5 kg/m2. Their temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a symmetrical rash over the shoulders and knees. A photograph of the rash on their left shoulder is shown. Rubbing the affected skin does not lead to upper epidermal layer separation from the lower layer. Their hemoglobin concentration is 10.2 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume is 63.2 μm3, and platelet count is 450,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this skin condition?","1. **Dapsone** - The most likely diagnosis is dermatitis herpetiformis, which is associated with celiac disease. Dapsone is the first-line treatment for dermatitis herpetiformis and can rapidly alleviate itching and rash.

2. **Gluten-free diet** - Although not a pharmacotherapy, initiating a strict gluten-free diet is crucial for long-term management of both dermatitis herpetiformis and the associated gastrointestinal symptoms due to celiac disease.

3. **Topical corticosteroids** - These could help alleviate severe itching and inflammation as an adjunctive treatment, but they are not the primary therapy for dermatitis herpetiformis.",Oral dapsone,Relevant
2,"An individual is brought to the emergency department by their roommate with a one-day history of fever and malaise. They did not feel well after class the previous night and have been in their room since then. They have not been eating or drinking due to severe nausea. Their roommate checked on them one hour ago and was alarmed to find a fever of 102°F (38.9°C). On physical exam, their temperature is 103°F (39.4°C), blood pressure is 110/66 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 23/min, and pulse oximetry is 98% on room air. They refuse to move their neck and have a rash on their trunk. You perform a lumbar puncture and the CSF analysis is shown below.

Appearance: Cloudy
Opening pressure: 180 mm H2O
WBC count: 150 cells/µL (93% PMN)
Glucose level: < 40 mg/dL
Protein level: 50 mg/dL
Gram stain: gram-negative diplococci

Based on this patient's clinical presentation, which of the following should most likely be administered?","1. *Ceftriaxone* - The patient’s presentation (fever, malaise, severe nausea, refusal to move the neck, and a rash) along with the CSF analysis suggests bacterial meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis (indicated by gram-negative diplococci on Gram stain). Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum third-generation cephalosporin frequently used to treat this pathogen. 

2. *Vancomycin* - This antibiotic is often used in conjunction with ceftriaxone to cover for other potential causes of bacterial meningitis, including resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, until the specific pathogen is confirmed and sensitivities are known.

3. *Dexamethasone* - Corticosteroids like dexamethasone may be administered alongside antibiotics to reduce inflammation and prevent complications such as neurologic damage. It is particularly useful in bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae type B, but can also be considered in other bacterial causes to reduce morbidity.

The immediate and primary treatment remains rapid administration of appropriate antibiotics following the initial clinical assessment and empirical diagnosis.",Ceftriaxone,Relevant
3,"An individual presents at 33 weeks gestation with several episodes of bloody spotting and mild vaginal bleeding over the past 2 weeks. The bleeding has no specific triggers and resolves spontaneously. No abdominal pain or uterine contractions are reported. This person has had two cesarean deliveries. At 20 weeks gestation, the ultrasound examination showed the placental edge to be 5 cm away from the internal cervical os. On examination at this visit, the vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 110/70 mm Hg; heart rate, 89/min; respiratory rate, 15/min; and temperature, 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The uterus is tender with no palpable contractions and streaks of blood are noted on the perineum, but there is no active bleeding. An ultrasound evaluation shows the placental edge 1 cm from the internal cervical os. Which of the following options best describes the placental position at each ultrasound?","1. **Low-Lying Placenta at Both Ultrasound Evaluations**: At 20 weeks gestation, the placental edge was 5 cm from the internal cervical os, which can be considered normal during early pregnancy. However, at 33 weeks gestation, the placental edge is now only 1 cm from the internal cervical os, indicating a low-lying placenta. The change in position from the earlier ultrasound suggests that as the uterus has grown, the placenta has moved closer to the cervical os, which can happen due to the dynamics of uterine enlargement.

2. **Normal Placental Position Initially, Progressing to Marginal Placenta Previa**: At the 20-week ultrasound, the placental edge was 5 cm away from the cervical os, indicating a normally positioned placenta. By 33 weeks, the placental edge is 1 cm from the os, progressing to a low-lying placenta or marginal placenta previa, where the placental edge is near but not covering the internal cervical os. This condition has increased the risk of bleeding as the pregnancy advances, especially given the history of previous cesarean sections which may contribute to abnormal placental adherence or position.

3. **Potential Placenta Previa Developing**: Initially, at 20 weeks, the placenta was at a normal distance from the internal cervix (5 cm distance), but as the pregnancy progressed to 33 weeks, the placental edge shifted closer to the cervix (1 cm away). This shift might indicate the development of placenta previa if the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix in subsequent weeks, significantly increasing the risk of bleeding as the pregnancy continues and as the cervix begins to efface and dilate in preparation for labor.",Normally lying placenta → marginal previa,Accurate
4,An individual comes to the physician with right-sided flank pain and blood in their urine for 1 day. They do not have fever or dysuria. They had similar symptoms several weeks ago but did not seek medical care at the time. Physical examination shows right costovertebral angle tenderness. Serum uric acid level is 6.9 mg/dL. Urine dipstick shows 3+ blood. Analysis of a 24-hour urine collection specimen shows wedge-shaped prisms. This patient is most likely to benefit from which of the following to prevent recurrence of this condition?,"1. Increased hydration – Maintaining adequate fluid intake can help dilute the urine and prevent the formation of kidney stones, which are likely in this scenario given the flank pain, hematuria, and the presence of wedge-shaped prisms suggesting uric acid stones.

2. Potassium citrate – This medication can alkalinize the urine, which helps dissolve uric acid stones and prevent the formation of new stones by maintaining a favorable urinary pH.

3. Allopurinol – This medication reduces the production of uric acid and may be beneficial for patients with recurrent uric acid stones, particularly if they have high serum uric acid levels or excessive urinary excretion of uric acid.",Chlorthalidone,Inaccurate
5,"A patient is in the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis and is currently on an insulin drip. The electrolytes are being checked every hour and the potassium is notable for the following measures:

3. 6.1 mEq/L
4. 6.2 mEq/L
5. 5.9 mEq/L
6. 5.1 mEq/L
7. 4.0 mEq/L
8. 3.1 mEq/L

Which of the following is the median potassium value of this data set?","To determine the median potassium value, the measures should be arranged in ascending order:

1. 3.1 mEq/L
2. 4.0 mEq/L
3. 5.1 mEq/L
4. 5.1 mEq/L
5. 5.8 mEq/L
6. 5.9 mEq/L
7. 6.1 mEq/L
8. 6.2 mEq/L

The median value is the middle value of a data set. Since there are 8 values, the median will be the average of the 4th and 5th values in this ordered list.

The 4th value is 5.1 mEq/L and the 5th value is 5.8 mEq/L.

So the median is:
(5.1 + 5.8) / 2 = 5.45 mEq/L

Therefore, the median potassium value is:

*1* 5.45 mEq/L",5.45,Accurate
6,An individual is brought to the emergency department after being stabbed with a knife during an altercation. Physical examination shows a 4-cm stab wound on the right lateral border of the T1 spinous process. An MRI of the spinal cord shows damage to the area of the right lateral corticospinal tract at the level of T1. Further evaluation will most likely show which of the following findings?,"1. *Ipsilateral spastic paralysis below the level of the lesion* - Damage to the lateral corticospinal tract, part of the pyramidal tract responsible for voluntary motor control, typically results in spastic paralysis on the same side of the body below the level of the lesion.

2. *Ipsilateral loss of fine touch and proprioception below the level of the lesion* - While the primary damage mentioned is to the lateral corticospinal tract, there is a possibility that surrounding structures, such as the dorsal columns, could be involved, leading to ipsilateral loss of fine touch and proprioception.

3. *Ipsilateral hyperreflexia below the level of the lesion* - Damage to the corticospinal tract often leads to disrupted motor control including increased reflexes (hyperreflexia) on the same side below the lesion.",Absence of right-sided motor function below T1,Relevant
7,"A patient presents with acute abdominal pain accompanied by chills, nausea, and vomiting. Their past medical history is significant for benign prostatic hyperplasia and diabetes mellitus type 2. Their medications are tamsulosin and metformin. Their last HbA1c, 5 months ago, was 6.7. They had a screening colonoscopy 5 years ago which was normal. They deny blood in the stool or urine and have had no change in bowel habits. Throughout the encounter, they have difficulty getting comfortable on the exam table. Their temperature is 38.2°C (100.7°F), the heart rate is 103/min, the respiratory rate is 15/min, and the blood pressure is 105/85 mm Hg. Physical exam is significant for left costovertebral angle tenderness. Peritoneal signs are absent. CBC, CMP, and urinalysis results are pending. Abdominal X-ray is shown. Which of the following is the next best step in management?","1. **Empiric antibiotic therapy and obtain a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis**: Given the patient's symptom profile, including left costovertebral angle tenderness, fever, elevated heart rate, and history of diabetes, a severe infection such as pyelonephritis or another urinary tract-related infection should be highly suspected. Starting empiric antibiotics while awaiting urine culture results and obtaining a CT scan can help confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications such as abscess formation.

2. **IV fluids and analgesia**: Considering the acute abdominal pain, fever, and possible infection, initiating intravenous fluid resuscitation and providing pain control are crucial in stabilizing the patient. This supportive management can help in improving perfusion and comfort while definitive diagnostic studies are conducted.

3. **Urine culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing**: Given the presenting symptoms and costovertebral angle tenderness, a urinary tract infection, possibly progressing to pyelonephritis, is a strong possibility, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus who are at higher risk for infections. Sending a urine culture and sensitivity test can help guide the antibiotic therapy according to the specific pathogen identified.",Surgical removal and antibiotics,Relevant
8,"An individual presents to the neurology clinic in significant pain. They report a sharp, stabbing electric-like pain on the right side of their face. The pain started suddenly 2 weeks ago. The pain is so excruciating that they can no longer laugh, speak, or eat meals, as these activities cause episodes of pain. They had to miss work last week as a result. Their attacks last about 3 minutes and go away when they go to sleep. They typically have 2–3 attacks per day now. The vital signs include: blood pressure 132/84 mm Hg, heart rate 79/min, and respiratory rate 14/min. A neurological examination shows no loss of crude touch, tactile touch, or pain sensations on the left side of the face. The pupillary light and accommodation reflexes are normal. There is no drooping of the mouth, ptosis, or anhidrosis noted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","1. **Trigeminal Neuralgia (Tic Douloureux)** - This is the most plausible diagnosis given the patient's description of sharp, electric-like pain on one side of the face that is triggered by activities such as speaking, laughing, or eating. Trigeminal neuralgia typically presents with sudden, severe, stabbing pain episodes lasting seconds to minutes, which can be triggered by everyday activities. There is usually no sensory loss or motor deficit on the affected side, aligning with the neurological examination findings.

2. **Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia** - This condition is less common but can present with similar pain characteristics. The pain in glossopharyngeal neuralgia is often located around the throat, tongue, tonsil, or ear but can also present as facial pain. The triggers and episodic nature of pain can resemble those of trigeminal neuralgia, but the specific location (primarily the throat and ear) typically differentiates it.

3. **Atypical Facial Pain (Persistent Idiopathic Facial Pain)** - This diagnosis is less likely but possible. It typically presents with chronic facial pain that does not follow the nerve distribution and is often constant rather than episodic. However, the lack of sensory loss or other neurological deficits makes it a differential to consider in the presence of chronic facial pain.",Trigeminal neuralgia,Relevant
9,An individual is being evaluated for an acquired defect of the myeloid stem cell line with a mutation in the PIG-A gene. The diagnosis was first suspected due to anemia and recurrent pink-tinged urine. Which of the markers will be negative in the flow cytometry test for this condition?,"1. **CD59** - This is a key marker that will be negative in conditions like paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which is associated with a PIG-A gene mutation. CD59 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, and its absence on the cell surface is a hallmark of PNH.

2. **CD55** - Similar to CD59, CD55 is also a GPI-anchored protein that will be negative in PNH due to the PIG-A gene mutation. The absence of CD55 on the cell surface also contributes to the pathology of PNH.

3. **CD16** - While CD16 is not as commonly noted in PNH diagnostics as CD55 and CD59, it can also be involved. Some PNH clones might show negative or decreased expression of CD16, which is another GPI-anchored protein, on flow cytometry.",CD55,Relevant
10,"A person with obesity and heart disease presents to your outpatient clinic with complaints of orthopnea, significant dyspnea on minimal exertion, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. They mention that their previous doctor prescribed ""some pills"" which are taken in varying amounts each morning. Physical examination reveals a severely displaced point of maximal impulse, bilateral rales in the lower lung fields, an S3 gallop, and hepatomegaly. You decide to perform an EKG (shown in figure A). Suddenly, the patient's rhythm changes to ventricular tachycardia followed by ventricular fibrillation, and despite resuscitative efforts, the patient does not survive. High levels of which medication are most likely responsible?","1. Digoxin - High levels of digoxin can cause a range of cardiac symptoms including arrhythmias, which can lead to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and signs of heart failure, along with the sudden fatal arrhythmia, are consistent with digoxin toxicity.

2. Beta-blockers (e.g., Metoprolol or Carvedilol) - These can cause and exacerbate heart failure symptoms and can lead to arrhythmias if not dosed correctly, especially in the setting of severe heart failure and electrolyte imbalances.

3. Diuretics (e.g., Furosemide) - Overuse of diuretics can cause significant electrolyte imbalances (particularly low potassium and magnesium) which can predispose to life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.",Digoxin,Relevant
11,"A previously healthy individual comes to the physician at the insistence of their partner because of a skin lesion on their back. They live with their partner and work for a high-profile law firm representing several major clients. Physical examination shows a 7-mm, brownish-black papule with irregular borders. When the doctor begins to mention possible diagnoses, the patient interrupts and says that they do not want to know the diagnosis and that the doctor should just do whatever they think is right. A biopsy of the skin lesion is performed and histological examination shows clusters of infiltrative melanocytes. Upon repeat questioning, the patient reaffirms their wish to not know the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate response from the physician?","1. Confirm the patient's preference to not know the diagnosis, respect their wishes, and continue with the necessary treatment and follow-up care as indicated, documenting the patient's preferences in their medical record.

2. Gently explain the importance of understanding their diagnosis for informed consent and ensure they are aware of the implications and choices available, but if the patient still wishes not to know, proceed with the necessary treatment while respecting their decision.

3. Encourage the patient to consider having a support person (e.g., their partner) be informed about the diagnosis and treatment plan, so that there is someone who understands the situation and can provide support, while still respecting the patient's wish not to know.","""""""I would like to know more about why you don't want to hear your test results.""""""",Relevant
12,"An individual comes to the physician with a 4-month history of chest pain that occurs on exertion. The pain is dull, and they experience retrosternal pressure when walking up the stairs to their apartment on the fifth floor. The pain disappears shortly after stopping for one minute.

LDL 110 mg/dL
HDL 50 mg/dL
A resting ECG shows no abnormalities. A week after uneventful initiation of aspirin, the individual is started on atorvastatin. This individual is most likely to develop which of the following?","1. *Stable Angina* - The symptoms described (dull chest pain and retrosternal pressure during exertion, which is relieved by rest) are classic for stable angina. This condition occurs due to myocardial ischemia typically as a result of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).

2. *Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)* - Given the patient's risk factors (hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia), they are at a higher risk of developing CAD, which leads to symptoms like exertional chest pain indicative of chronic ischemic heart disease.

3. *Myocardial Infarction (MI)* - Although less immediate than stable angina, if the underlying atherosclerotic disease progresses, the patient may eventually be at risk for an acute coronary syndrome, including myocardial infarction, if a coronary plaque becomes unstable or ruptures.",Elevated transaminases,Inaccurate
13,"An individual presents with a yellow coloration of their skin. They feel well and deny any recent history of nausea, fatigue, fever, or discoloration of urine or stool. The individual reports episodes with similar symptoms in the past. Family history is significant for similar symptoms in a parent. The patient is afebrile and vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, they are jaundiced, and scleral icterus is present. Laboratory findings are significant only for an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Liver enzymes are normal, and there is no bilirubin present in the urine. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient’s most likely diagnosis?","1. **Reassurance and patient education**: The most likely diagnosis given the family history, repeated episodes, and the presence of jaundice with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and otherwise normal labs is Gilbert's syndrome. Gilbert's syndrome is a benign hereditary condition that does not require any specific treatment. Reassurance and education about the nature of the condition, including advice on avoiding potential triggers such as fasting or stress, is the best approach.

2. **None**: Since Gilbert's syndrome generally does not cause any significant health problems, specific medical treatments are not necessary. Monitoring and regular follow-up may be recommended to ensure no other underlying conditions are present.

3. **Avoidance of triggering factors**: While specific treatments are usually not required for Gilbert's syndrome, advising the patient to avoid known triggers that can precipitate episodes of jaundice, such as dehydration, fasting, strenuous exercise, and stressful situations, may help in managing and reducing the frequency of episodes.",No therapy indicated,Relevant

Muscle strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities is normal. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. On mental status examination, mood is admitted to be 'not that great'. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 59 mm/h and serum creatine kinase is 38 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's headache?","1. **Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis)** - This patient presents with muscle pain and weakness, weight loss, fatigue, headaches, and jaw claudication, which are classic symptoms of giant cell arteritis. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) further supports this diagnosis. Prompt treatment is essential to prevent complications such as vision loss.

2. **Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)** - While this condition itself does not directly cause headaches, it is often associated with giant cell arteritis. PMR causes muscle pain and stiffness, particularly in the shoulders and hips, and can coexist with giant cell arteritis, which could explain the headaches.

3. **Tension-type headache (TTH)** - Though not the primary suspicion given the systemic symptoms, stress and fatigue can contribute to tension-type headaches. However, with the given systemic inflammatory signs and symptoms, this is less likely compared to the first two options.",Giant cell arteritis,accurate
15,"An individual comes to the physician for evaluation of a delayed menstrual period and intermittent lower abdominal pain for 2 days. Menarche occurred at the age of 12 years, and menses have occurred at regular 28-day intervals. The last menstrual period was 7 weeks ago. Two years ago, this individual was treated for chlamydia infection. Pelvic examination shows a soft, mildly enlarged uterus. Endometrial biopsy shows decidualization of the endometrium without chorionic villi. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?","1. **Positive β-hCG test** - The delayed menstrual period and intermittent lower abdominal pain, along with decidualization of the endometrium, suggest pregnancy. The most definitive test to confirm pregnancy is a positive β-hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) test.

2. **Ectopic pregnancy** - Given the history of chlamydia infection—which can increase the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and subsequently cause scarring and damage to the fallopian tubes—an ectopic pregnancy is a likely possibility. Decidualization in the endometrium without chorionic villi is indicative of pregnancy, but without intrauterine pregnancy, suggesting ectopic implantation.

3. **Elevated progesterone levels** - Decidualization of the endometrium is influenced by elevated progesterone levels, which occur during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and in early pregnancy. Elevated progesterone levels would support the diagnosis of pregnancy, albeit without specifying location (i.e., intrauterine versus ectopic).",Fertilized ovum outside the uterus,Relevant
