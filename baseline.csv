0,"An 85-year-old man presents with the reappearance of his Parkinson’s disease (PD) symptoms over the last few months. He says he has been treated with various drugs over the last 20 years, but that currently his symptoms worsen as he nears the time for his next dose of medication. His movements have been slower lately and it’s difficult to initiate voluntary movements. His past medical history is significant for hypertension. He was diagnosed 10 years ago and was well-managed on medication. His current medications are levodopa/carbidopa, rasagiline, aspirin, and captopril. The vital signs include: pulse 70/min, respiratory rate 15/min, blood pressure 130/76 mm Hg, and temperature 36.7°C (98.1°F). Physical examination reveals the expected ‘pill-rolling’ resting tremor, which is alleviated by movement. Increased tone of arm muscles and resistance to passive movement at the joints is noted. When asked to walk across the room, he has difficulty taking the 1st step and has a stooped posture and takes short, shuffling, rapid steps. Laboratory studies show:

An ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?","*1* The most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition is administration of *physostigmine*. Physostigmine is a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor that can cross the blood-brain barrier and acts centrally to increase acetylcholine levels. It is used in the treatment of anticholinergic toxicity, which can present with symptoms such as confusion, tachycardia, dry skin, dilated pupils, and elevated temperature. It is important to note that physostigmine should be used cautiously and only by healthcare professionals experienced in its administration due to the risk of cholinergic toxicity.

*2* Another appropriate treatment for this patient's condition is *supportive care and monitoring*. This may include maintaining the airway, breathing, and circulation, as well as monitoring vital signs and providing symptomatic treatment as needed. In cases of drug overdose, it is important to monitor for complications and provide supportive care until the effects of the ingested substance wear off.

*3* It is also important to consult with a *toxicologist or poison control center* for guidance on managing the patient's condition. Toxicologists are experts in the management of poisoning and overdose cases and can provide valuable recommendations on treatment strategies, including the use of specific antidotes or interventions based on the ingested substance and clinical presentation.",Physostigmine,Accurate.

An x-ray of the hip shows cortical thickening and prominent trabecular markings. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?""","1. Paget's disease of bone: This patient's symptoms, including chronic dull pain in the hip and lower back, worsening with exertion and at night, along with the findings on x-ray of cortical thickening and prominent trabecular markings, are highly suggestive of Paget's disease of bone. This disease is characterized by excessive and disorganized bone remodeling, leading to weakened, deformed, and enlarged bones, as seen in the x-ray findings.

2. Prostate cancer metastasis to bone: Given the family history of prostate cancer and the patient's symptoms of progressive pain in the hip and lower back, prostate cancer metastasis to bone is also a possibility.

1. Marfan syndrome: This patient presents with a combination of physical examination findings consistent with Marfan syndrome, including long fingers, funnel chest, and disproportionate body proportions. The aortic root dilatation identified on echocardiography is a typical feature of Marfan syndrome, predisposing the patient to aortic dissection and the need for surgical intervention.

Blood hemoglobin concentration 14 g/dL
Arterial oxygen content 0.22 mL O2/mL
Arterial oxygen saturation 98%
Venous oxygen content 0.17 mL O2/mL
Venous oxygen saturation 78%
Oxygen consumption 250 mL/min
The patient's pulse is 75/min, respiratory rate is 14/ min, and blood pressure is 125/70 mm Hg. What is the cardiac output of this volunteer?","*1* The Fick principle is commonly used to calculate cardiac output based on the principles of mass balance. The formula states:
Cardiac Output = (Oxygen Consumption) / ((Arterial Oxygen Content - Venous Oxygen Content) * Hemoglobin concentration)
Using the provided data:
Cardiac Output = (250 mL/min) / ((0.22 mL O2/mL - 0.17 mL O2/mL) * 14 g/dL)
Cardiac Output = 250 / (0.05 * 14)
Cardiac Output = 3571.43 mL/min

*2* Another method to calculate cardiac output is by using the formula: 
Cardiac Output = Heart Rate * Stroke Volume
Given:
Heart Rate = 75 beats/min
Stroke Volume = (Arterial Oxygen Content - Venous Oxygen Content) * Hemoglobin concentration * 10
Stroke Volume = (0.22 - 0.17) * 14 * 10
Stroke Volume = 0.05 * 14 * 10
Stroke Volume = 70 mL/beat
Cardiac Output = 75 * 70
Cardiac Output = 5250 mL/min

*3* A third approach to estimate cardiac output is the physiologic formula:
Cardiac Output = (oxygen consumption) / (arterial-venous oxygen content difference)
Given:
Arterial-venous oxygen content difference = 0.22 - 0.17 = 0.05 mL O2/mL
Cardiac Output = 250 / 0.05
Cardiac Output = 5000 mL/min",5.0 L/min,Inaccurate

The patient denies any associated change in the pain with breathing or body position. He says he has associated nausea but denies any vomiting. He denies any recent history of fever, chills, or chronic cough. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus for which he takes lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, simvastatin, and metformin. He reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and has 1–2 alcoholic drinks during the weekend.

His blood pressure is 220/110 mm Hg in the right arm and 180/100 mm Hg in the left arm. On physical examination, the patient is diaphoretic. Cardiac exam reveals a grade 2/6 diastolic decrescendo murmur loudest over the left sternal border. Remainder of the physical examination is normal. The chest radiograph shows a widened mediastinum. The electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals non-specific ST segment and T wave changes. Intravenous morphine and beta-blockers are started. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","*1* 1. Aortic dissection: The patient's presentation of severe chest pain radiating to the back and shoulders, widened mediastinum on chest radiograph, and a diastolic decrescendo murmur consistent with aortic regurgitation suggest a diagnosis of aortic dissection. The patient's history of hypertension, family history of aortic dissection, and presence of risk factors like smoking and chronic hypertension support this diagnosis.

*2* 2. Acute myocardial infarction: While the patient's symptoms of chest pain and diaphoresis are concerning for an acute myocardial infarction, the presence of a widened mediastinum on chest radiograph and a diastolic murmur make aortic dissection a more likely diagnosis.

*3* 3. Pulmonary embolism: While pulmonary embolism can present with chest pain and shortness of breath, the absence of risk factors like recent surgery, immobility, or malignancy, along with the patient's medical history and physical exam findings, make this diagnosis less likely compared to aortic dissection.",Aortic dissection,Relevant
