Peritoneal fluid Gram stain is negative. Culture and cytology results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?""","*1* The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is hepatic hydrothorax, which is a complication of cirrhosis. The patient's history of untreated hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease in his father, and current alcohol consumption increase the suspicion for cirrhosis.

*2* Another possible cause of the patient's symptoms is heart failure. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure, which can present with abdominal distension, nausea, and decreased appetite due to fluid overload and congestion.

*3* Lastly, the patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and elevated HbA1c level suggest the possibility of diabetic gastroparesis, which can present with abdominal discomfort, nausea, and decreased appetite. However, given the patient's presentation of shifting dullness and peritoneal fluid analysis showing triglycerides of 360 mg/dL, along with the other findings, hepatic hydrothorax and cirrhosis are more likely in this case.",Lymphoma,Relevant

2,"A 58-year-old chronic smoker known to have chronic bronchitis for the last 20 years presents to his physician for a scheduled follow-up visit. He mentions that over the last month he has been having difficulty breathing, especially after climbing stairs. He also says that he has had similar episodes in the past, which were relieved with the use of inhaled bronchodilators, but recently the breathlessness has ceased to respond to them. He also mentions frequent pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. On physical examination, his temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), the pulse is 96/min, the blood pressure is 124/82 mm Hg, and the respirations are 26/min. Auscultation of the chest reveals wheezing bilaterally and a loud pulmonic component of the second heart sound. Two-dimensional echocardiography shows a dilated right ventricle with increased wall thickness. Right heart catheterization is performed, which indicates a pulmonary artery pressure of 30 mm Hg and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 13 mm Hg. There is a significant drop in pulmonary artery pressure after the administration of inhaled nitric oxide. In addition to continued appropriate management of chronic bronchitis, which of the following medications is most likely to improve symptoms in the patient?","*1* 1. Bosentan: Bosentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist that can help improve symptoms in patients with pulmonary hypertension, which this patient likely has given the presentation of dyspnea on exertion, dilated right ventricle, and elevated pulmonary artery pressure. It acts by causing vasodilation in the pulmonary vasculature, reducing pulmonary vascular resistance.

*2* 2. Sildenafil: Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor that works by relaxing the smooth muscle in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to vasodilation and reduced pulmonary vascular resistance. This can help improve symptoms in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

*3* 3. Acetylcysteine: Acetylcysteine is a mucolytic agent commonly used in patients with chronic bronchitis to help improve mucus clearance. While beneficial for clearing secretions in the airways, it is less likely to address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is likely pulmonary hypertension in this case.",Diltiazem,Relevant

Which of the following best explains this patient's symptoms?""","1. HELLP syndrome: The patient's presentation of epigastric pain, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, hemolysis (as evidenced by low hemoglobin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase), and proteinuria is highly concerning for HELLP syndrome, a severe variant of preeclampsia that can cause liver dysfunction and hemolysis.

2. Preeclampsia: Preeclampsia typically presents with hypertension, proteinuria, and can have associated symptoms such as epigastric pain, nausea, and headache. This patient's elevated blood pressure and proteinuria are consistent with preeclampsia, but the severe thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes suggest a more severe form of the disease like HELLP syndrome.

3. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy: This is a rare but serious condition that can present similarly to HELLP syndrome with symptoms such as epigastric pain, elevated liver enzymes, and hemolysis. However, the patient's normal total bilirubin makes this diagnosis less likely compared to HELLP syndrome.",Stretching of Glisson capsule,Inaccurate.
10,"A medical technician is trying to isolate a pathogen from the sputum sample of a patient. The sample is heat fixed to a slide then covered with carbol fuchsin stain and heated again.

On physical exam, she is an obese woman in acute distress. She is diaphoretic and has difficulty catching her breath. A bedside electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed which reveals ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Which of the following is the most probable diagnosis?","1. Acute inferior myocardial infarction: Given the patient's symptoms of crushing chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, and difficulty catching her breath coupled with ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF on ECG, it is highly likely she is experiencing an acute inferior myocardial infarction.

2. Coronary artery spasm: The patient's risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and stress could predispose her to coronary artery spasm, which can present similarly to a myocardial infarction but may not lead to permanent damage of the heart muscle. However, the ECG findings of ST-segment elevation make myocardial infarction more likely.

3. Stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy): The patient's stressful job may increase her risk for stress-induced cardiomyopathy, also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which can present similarly to a myocardial infarction with chest pain and ECG changes.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?","*1* 1. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES): Given the history of recent sexual assault and extreme distress, the presentation of convulsions in the absence of an underlying neurological cause points towards psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). These seizures are usually related to underlying psychological stressors and do not have the characteristic electrical discharges seen in epileptic seizures.

*2* 2. Conversion disorder: This patient's presentation is consistent with conversion disorder, a condition where psychological stressors manifest as physical symptoms, in this case, convulsions. The patient's recent sexual assault and extreme distress are likely contributing to the development of these symptoms.

*3* 3. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): While PTSD can manifest with symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares, and severe anxiety, in some cases, it can also present with dissociative symptoms like convulsions, known as dissociative seizures or attacks.
