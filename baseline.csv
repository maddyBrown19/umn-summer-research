0,"An individual presents to the emergency room complaining of headaches and palpitations. They report that they initially started experiencing these symptoms several months prior but attributed them to stress at work. The symptoms occur episodically. Their family history is notable for medullary thyroid cancer and hyperparathyroidism. Their temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 165/90 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On examination, they appear tremulous. Urine metanephrines are elevated. Which of the following is the most appropriate first medication in the management of this patient’s condition?","The most appropriate first medication for a patient presenting with episodic headaches, palpitations, elevated blood pressure, and elevated urine metanephrines, suggestive of a pheochromocytoma, is an alpha-adrenergic blocker. Here are the top three options:

1. **Phenoxybenzamine**: This is a non-selective, irreversible alpha-adrenergic blocker commonly used as the first line of treatment to control blood pressure and mitigate symptoms associated with pheochromocytoma.

2. **Doxazosin**: This is a selective alpha-1 adrenergic blocker that can also be used to manage hypertension in pheochromocytoma patients.

3. **Prazosin**: Another selective alpha-1 adrenergic blocker, which can be utilized in managing symptoms and hypertension due to pheochromocytoma.

It's critical to start with an alpha-adrenergic blocker before introducing a beta-blocker if needed, to prevent unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, which can lead to a hypertensive crisis.",Phenoxybenzamine,Accurate
1,"A patient comes to the physician for the evaluation of a skin rash over both shoulders and elbows for the past 5 days. The patient reports severe itching and burning sensation. There is no history of serious illness except for recurrent episodes of diarrhea and abdominal cramps, which have occurred occasionally over the past three months. The stools are described as greasy and foul-smelling. The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol. No illicit drugs are used, and no medications are taken. The patient is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 60 kg (132 lb); BMI is 18.5 kg/m2. Temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a symmetrical rash over the shoulders and knees. A photograph of the rash on the left shoulder is shown. Rubbing the affected skin does not lead to upper epidermal layer separation from the lower layer. Hemoglobin concentration is 10.2 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume is 63.2 μm3, and platelet count is 450,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this skin condition?","Based on the patient’s symptoms, including a symmetrical rash on the shoulders and knees, severe itching, burning sensation, and gastrointestinal issues such as greasy and foul-smelling stools, the most likely diagnosis is **dermatitis herpetiformis**. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic, intensely itchy rash associated with celiac disease, which is consistent with the patient’s history of gastrointestinal symptoms and lab findings indicative of possible iron deficiency anemia.

Here are the top three treatments for dermatitis herpetiformis:

1. **Dapsone**: This is the primary treatment for the skin manifestations of dermatitis herpetiformis. It helps reduce itching and rash quickly and is effective in controlling the symptoms.

2. **Gluten-Free Diet**: As dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with celiac disease, adherence to a strict gluten-free diet is crucial. This dietary change helps manage the underlying condition and can lead to long-term improvement in both gastrointestinal and skin symptoms.

3. **Topical Steroids**: While not a first-line treatment, topical corticosteroids can occasionally be used for symptomatic relief of the rash. However, their effectiveness is limited compared to dapsone.

Dapsone is the preferred pharmacotherapy for direct management of the rash associated with dermatitis herpetiformis.",Oral dapsone,Relevant
2,"An individual is brought to the emergency department by their roommate with a one-day history of fever and malaise. They did not feel well after class the previous night and have been in their room since then. They have not been eating or drinking due to severe nausea. Their roommate checked on them one hour ago and was alarmed to find a fever of 102°F (38.9°C). On physical exam, the temperature is 103°F (40°C), blood pressure is 110/66 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 23/min, and pulse oximetry is 98% on room air.

Glucose level: < 40 mg/dL
Protein level: 50 mg/dL
Gram stain: gram-negative diplococci

Based on this patient's clinical presentation, which of the following should most likely be administered?","Based on the patient's clinical presentation and CSF findings, the most likely diagnosis is bacterial meningitis, specifically due to Neisseria meningitidis, given the gram-negative diplococci on Gram stain. The top three treatments that should be administered include:

1. **Empirical Intravenous Antibiotics**: 
   - **Ceftriaxone or Cefotaxime**: These third-generation cephalosporins are effective against Neisseria meningitidis.
   - **Vancomycin**: This could be added until culture results confirm the pathogen and sensitivities, especially to cover for other potential organisms like Streptococcus pneumoniae.

2. **Dexamethasone**:
   - Dexamethasone is recommended to be administered before or with the first dose of antibiotics to reduce the risk of complications, such as neurologic damage and hearing loss, particularly in cases suspected of pneumococcal meningitis, though its use can be considered in meningococcal meningitis as well.

3. **Supportive Care**:
   - **Intravenous Fluid Resuscitation**: To address dehydration and support blood pressure, especially given the patient’s nausea and likely poor oral intake.
   - **Antipyretics**: To manage fever and provide symptomatic relief.

These treatments are critical to manage the acute infection and prevent complications. Immediate administration is necessary in this potentially life-threatening situation.",Ceftriaxone,Relevant
3,"A person presents at 33 weeks gestation with several episodes of bloody spotting and mild vaginal bleeding over the past 2 weeks. The bleeding has no specific triggers and resolves spontaneously. They do not report abdominal pain or uterine contractions. They have had two cesarean deliveries. At 20 weeks gestation, the ultrasound examination showed the placental edge to be 5 cm away from the internal cervical os. On examination at this visit, the vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 110/70 mm Hg; heart rate, 89/min; respiratory rate, 15/min; and temperature, 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The uterus is tender with no palpable contractions and streaks of blood are noted on the perineum, but there is no active bleeding. An ultrasound evaluation shows the placental edge 1 cm from the internal cervical os. Which of the following options best describes the placental position at each ultrasound?","The findings on the ultrasound evaluations can be described using the following terminology:

1. **First Ultrasound (20 weeks gestation): Low-Lying Placenta**
   - At 20 weeks gestation, the placental edge was 5 cm away from the internal cervical os. This is typically described as a low-lying placenta, where the placenta is close to, but not covering, the internal cervical os.

2. **Second Ultrasound (33 weeks gestation): Marginal Placenta Previa**
   - At 33 weeks gestation, the placental edge is 1 cm away from the internal cervical os, which is still quite near the opening of the cervix and can be described as marginal placenta previa. 

These two ultrasound findings suggest that the placenta is in a position that could cause bleeding (as noted with the episodes of bloody spotting and mild vaginal bleeding).

Additionally, considering the symptoms and history, the case could be monitored for the risk of complete placenta previa or an increasing likelihood of complications related to placental positioning. Regular follow-ups and monitoring would be essential to ensure the safety of both the mother and the fetus.",Normally lying placenta → marginal previa,Relevant
4,An individual comes to the physician with right-sided flank pain and blood in their urine for 1 day. They do not have fever or dysuria. They had similar symptoms several weeks ago but did not seek medical care at the time. Physical examination shows right costovertebral angle tenderness. Serum uric acid level is 6.9 mg/dL. Urine dipstick shows 3+ blood. Analysis of a 24-hour urine collection specimen shows wedge-shaped prisms. This patient is most likely to benefit from which of the following to prevent recurrence of their condition?,"Given the presentation, the most likely diagnosis is uric acid kidney stones. To prevent recurrence, the patient is most likely to benefit from:

1. **Increased Fluid Intake**: Ensuring adequate hydration helps in diluting the urine, preventing the supersaturation of uric acid and the formation of new stones.

2. **Alkalinization of Urine**: Medications such as potassium citrate can be used to alkalinize the urine. Alkalinization helps to dissolve uric acid stones and prevent their formation by keeping the urine pH above 6.0.

3. **Dietary Modifications**: Reducing intake of purine-rich foods (such as red meat, organ meats, and certain fish) and following a low-protein, low-purine diet can help lower uric acid levels in the urine, thus preventing stone formation.

These measures collectively help in reducing the concentration of uric acid in the urine and the likelihood of stone formation.",Chlorthalidone,Relevant

6,An individual is brought to the emergency department after being stabbed with a knife during an altercation. Physical examination shows a 4-cm stab wound on the right lateral border of the T1 spinous process. An MRI of the spinal cord shows damage to the area of the right lateral corticospinal tract at the level of T1. Further evaluation will most likely show which of the following findings?,"In a patient with damage to the right lateral corticospinal tract at the level of T1, further evaluation will most likely show the following findings:

1. **Ipsilateral spastic paresis below the level of injury**: The lateral corticospinal tract carries motor signals from the brain to the muscles, and damage to this pathway results in weakness and increased muscle tone (spasticity) specifically on the same side (ipsilateral) as the injury.
   
2. **Positive Babinski sign on the right side**: This is an abnormal reflex response where the big toe extends upward and the other toes fan out when the sole of the foot is stimulated. It is indicative of upper motor neuron damage on the same side (ipsilateral) as the injury.

3. **Ipsilateral loss of fine motor control below T1**: The corticospinal tract is responsible for skilled and precise movements. Damage at T1 on the right side will impair fine motor control on the right side of the body below the level of the injury.",Absence of right-sided motor function below T1,Relevant

Physical exam is significant for left costovertebral angle tenderness. Peritoneal signs are absent. CBC, CMP, and urinalysis results are pending. Abdominal X-ray is shown. Which of the following is the next best step in management?","For acute abdominal pain with left costovertebral angle tenderness, fever, and systemic symptoms in a patient with diabetes and benign prostatic hyperplasia, the following steps should be considered:

1. **Abdominal and Pelvic CT Scan**: Given the significant left costovertebral angle tenderness and systemic symptoms, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast would be the next best step to identify possible causes such as pyelonephritis, renal or ureteral stones, or other intra-abdominal pathologies.

2. **Empirical Antibiotic Therapy**: Given the fever, elevated heart rate, and left costovertebral angle tenderness, empiric antibiotic therapy should be started to cover potential urinary tract infection (considering pyelonephritis) while awaiting culture results.

3. **Intravenous Fluids and Pain Management**: Providing IV fluids and pain management is crucial to stabilize the patient, manage symptoms, and prevent further complications, especially considering the patient's diabetes and potential renal involvement.

A neurological examination shows no loss of crude touch, tactile touch, or pain sensations on the left side of the face. The pupillary light and accommodation reflexes are normal. There is no drooping of their mouth, ptosis, or anhidrosis noted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","The described symptoms are indicative of a specific neurologic condition. Here are the top three likely diagnoses:

1. **Trigeminal Neuralgia**: This condition, also known as tic douloureux, typically presents with sharp, stabbing, electric shock-like pain on one side of the face, often triggered by activities such as speaking, chewing, or touching the face. The duration and nature of pain attacks described align closely with trigeminal neuralgia.

2. **Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia**: This condition produces symptoms similar to trigeminal neuralgia but involves the glossopharyngeal nerve. It can cause severe, shooting pain in areas innervated by this nerve, including the throat, back of the tongue, and ear, and can be triggered by swallowing or talking.

3. **Cluster Headache**: Although less likely given the description, cluster headaches could present with severe unilateral facial pain. However, this pain is usually centered around the eye, accompanied by autonomic symptoms such as tearing, nasal congestion, or eyelid drooping, which do not seem to be present in this case.

You decide to perform an EKG (shown in figure A). Suddenly, the individual's rhythm changes to ventricular tachycardia followed by ventricular fibrillation, and they syncopize and expire despite resuscitative efforts. High levels of which medication are most likely responsible?","Given the clinical presentation and findings, including the patient's history of heart disease and medication use, the likely culprit in this case is a medication used to treat heart conditions. Here are the top three medications, high levels of which could explain the patient's symptoms and unfortunate outcome:

1. **Digoxin:** Overdose or toxicity of digoxin can lead to various cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, which can be fatal. Symptoms of digoxin toxicity can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and significant changes in ECG, such as ventricular arrhythmias. The patient's symptoms and ECG changes may suggest digoxin toxicity.

2. **Beta-blockers (e.g., Metoprolol):** Excessive dosing of beta-blockers can lead to severe bradycardia, hypotension, and resultant cardiac arrest. However, beta-blockers are less likely to cause the ventricular tachycardia followed by ventricular fibrillation compared to digoxin.

3. **Calcium channel blockers (e.g., Diltiazem, Verapamil):** Overdose of calcium channel blockers can result in severe hypotension, bradycardia, and potential progression to ventricular arrhythmias if myocardial function is severely depressed. However, calcium channel blockers are more commonly associated with bradyarrhythmias rather than ventricular arrhythmias.

Given the totality of the clinical picture and the more specific alignment of symptoms with digoxin toxicity, **digoxin** is the most likely medication responsible.",Digoxin,Relevant
11,"A previously healthy person comes to the physician at a partner's insistence because of a skin lesion on their back. They live with their partner and work for a high-profile law firm where they represent several major clients. Physical examination shows a 7-mm, brownish-black papule with irregular borders. When the doctor starts to mention possible diagnoses, the patient interrupts and says that they do not want to know the diagnosis and that the doctor should just do whatever they think is right. A biopsy of the skin lesion is performed and histological examination shows clusters of infiltrative melanocytes. Upon repeat questioning, the patient reaffirms their wish to not know the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate response from the physician?","The appropriate response from the physician in this scenario involves respecting the patient's autonomy while ensuring they receive the necessary medical care. Here are the top three responses that are appropriate for this situation:

1. **Respecting the patient's autonomy**: The physician should acknowledge and respect the patient's wish to not be informed about the diagnosis directly. The doctor can proceed with the treatment plan without explicitly discussing the diagnosis, focusing on the steps that need to be taken next and ensuring the patient understands the procedures and potential follow-ups without diving into the specifics of the diagnosis.

2. **Informing the patient of the next steps**: The physician can explain the necessity of the follow-up actions, such as further tests, monitoring, or treatments, without explicitly stating that the lesion is malignant. The explanation can emphasize the importance of addressing the issue promptly and what the care plan entails moving forward.

3. **Offering support and resources**: The physician can offer support, such as counseling services or a patient advocate, to help the patient cope with their situation without explicitly mentioning the diagnosis. This ensures that the patient has access to emotional and psychological support if they eventually choose to seek more information about their condition.

The physician must maintain a balance between respecting the patient's wishes and providing appropriate care, ensuring that the patient is adequately informed about the necessary medical actions without imposing the specific diagnosis on them.","""""""I would like to know more about why you don't want to hear your test results.""""""",Inaccurate

This patient is most likely to develop which of the following?","Based on the patient's presentation and condition, the top three diagnoses or complications that this patient is most likely to develop are:

1. **Stable Angina (Angina Pectoris)**:
   - The presentation of chest pain on exertion that subsides with rest is a classic symptom of stable angina. This condition is due to underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) where the heart muscle doesn't get enough blood supply during increased activity or stress due to partial blockage of one or more coronary arteries.

2. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**:
   - Although currently he presents with stable angina, it's possible that if the condition is left untreated or progresses, it may lead to acute coronary syndrome, including conditions such as unstable angina or myocardial infarction (heart attack). This occurs when there is a sudden blockage of coronary arteries.

3. **Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)**:
   - Over time, untreated or poorly managed CAD and persistent hypertension can lead to the weakening of the heart muscle, resulting in heart failure. This condition is characterized by the heart's inability to pump blood effectively which can lead to symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention.

These potential developments highlight the importance of managing the patient's cardiovascular risk factors, including weight, blood pressure, and lipid profile, alongside symptomatic treatments like aspirin and statins.",Elevated transaminases,Inaccurate

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this person’s most likely diagnosis?","Given the patient's symptoms, family history, and laboratory findings, they likely have Gilbert’s syndrome, a common and benign condition characterized by intermittent jaundice due to elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin. Here are the top three answers regarding the most appropriate treatment for this condition:

1. **Reassurance and Education**: Since Gilbert’s syndrome is a benign condition that does not typically require treatment, the main approach is to reassure the patient and provide education about the nature of the syndrome. Patients should be informed that the condition is harmless and does not require specific therapy.

2. **Lifestyle and Dietary Management**: While specific dietary changes are not usually necessary, some patients might benefit from advice to avoid factors that can exacerbate jaundice, such as fasting, dehydration, or significant stress. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help minimize symptoms.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-up**: Routine monitoring or follow-up isn't required for Gilbert's syndrome beyond initial diagnosis unless the patient develops additional symptoms that could suggest another underlying condition. If necessary, periodic assessment of bilirubin levels could be conducted to reassure the patient.

No pharmacological treatment is typically required for Gilbert’s syndrome, and the focus remains on non-interventional management and supportive care.",No therapy indicated,Relevant

Their erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 59 mm/h and serum creatine kinase is 38 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's headache?","The most likely causes of this patient's headache include:

1. **Temporal Arteritis (Giant Cell Arteritis)**: This condition is characterized by inflammation of the temporal arteries and other medium-to-large arteries. Symptoms often include headaches, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, visual disturbances, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The presence of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) symptoms such as muscle pain and stiffness, especially in older adults, further supports this diagnosis.

2. **Tension-Type Headache**: Although not typically accompanied by systemic symptoms like fever and weight loss, chronic stress and poor sleep can lead to tension-type headaches. However, this is less likely given the concurrent systemic symptoms and lab findings.

3. **Secondary Headache due to Trauma**: Given the history of a recent fall and head injury, there could be a post-traumatic headache. However, the chronicity and additional systemic symptoms make temporal arteritis a more probable primary cause.

Given the clinical context and lab findings, temporal arteritis is the most probable diagnosis. Immediate treatment with corticosteroids is often initiated to prevent complications such as vision loss. A temporal artery biopsy can confirm the diagnosis.",Giant cell arteritis,Relevant

Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?","The patient presents with a delayed menstrual period, intermittent lower abdominal pain, and an endometrial biopsy revealing decidualization of the endometrium without chorionic villi. The history of a previous chlamydia infection also raises concerns regarding potential reproductive complications. The top three likely findings in further evaluation are:

1. **Ectopic pregnancy**:
   - The absence of chorionic villi in the endometrial biopsy indicates that the pregnancy might not be within the uterine cavity. The symptoms, including delayed menstruation and lower abdominal pain, are consistent with an ectopic pregnancy. A transvaginal ultrasound and measurement of serum beta-hCG levels would be warranted to confirm this diagnosis.

2. **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)**:
   - Given the history of chlamydia infection, the patient may have developed PID, which can cause lower abdominal pain and affect the normal function of the fallopian tubes, potentially leading to an ectopic pregnancy.

3. **Hydatidiform mole**:
   - Although less likely given the current information, the possibility of a molar pregnancy arises whenever there are abnormalities in the endometrial lining. However, the more prominent symptoms and diagnostic findings typical of a molar pregnancy (such as markedly elevated beta-hCG levels and characteristic ""snowstorm"" appearance on ultrasound) are not described here.

19,"During a study on gastrointestinal hormones, a volunteer is administered the hormone secreted by S cells. Which of the following changes most likely represent the effect of this hormone on gastric and duodenal secretions?
 $$$ Gastric H+ %%% Duodenal HCO3- %%% Duodenal Cl- $$$","1. **Decrease in Gastric H+**: The hormone secreted by S cells is secretin, which inhibits gastric acid secretion. This leads to a decrease in gastric H+ production.
  
2. **Increase in Duodenal HCO3-**: Secretin stimulates the pancreas to release bicarbonate (HCO3-) into the duodenum, neutralizing the acidic chyme entering from the stomach.

3. **Decrease in Duodenal Cl-**: As bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions are secreted into the duodenum, they often exchange with chloride (Cl-) ions, resulting in a relative decrease in the concentration of chloride in the duodenum.",↓ ↑ ↓,Relevant
