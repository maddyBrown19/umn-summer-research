However, the presence of autoimmune thyroid disease in the patient's family history makes autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type II a more likely diagnosis.

3. **Celiac disease**: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by an intolerance to gluten which can lead to malabsorption of nutrients, resulting in weight loss, fatigue, and vitamin deficiencies. However, the foul-smelling stools, ulcers in the upper gastrointestinal tract, and family history of autoimmune thyroid disease are not typical of celiac disease.",Inactivation of pancreatic enzymes,Inaccurate.

35,"A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department after an episode of syncope. He states that for the past month ever since starting a new job he has experienced an episode of syncope or near-syncope every morning while he is getting dressed. The patient states that he now gets dressed, shaves, and puts on his tie sitting down to avoid falling when he faints. He has never had this before and is concerned it is stress from his new job as he has been unemployed for the past 5 years. He is wondering if he can get a note for work since he was unable to head in today secondary to his presentation. The patient has no significant past medical history and is otherwise healthy. His temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 122/83 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. Cardiopulmonary and neurologic exams are within normal limits. An initial ECG and laboratory values are unremarkable as well. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","1. **Vasovagal syncope**: This patient’s history of syncope occurring in specific situations, such as while he is getting dressed in the morning, suggests vasovagal syncope. Vasovagal syncope is a common cause of fainting and is typically triggered by stress, pain, or sudden changes in position. It is often preceded by prodromal symptoms like lightheadedness or nausea. In this case, the patient modifies his behavior to prevent injury by sitting down while getting dressed. 

2. **Orthostatic hypotension**: This condition could also present with syncope upon standing or changing positions. However, it is less likely in this case since the syncope primarily occurs during a specific routine (getting dressed in the morning) rather than upon standing or changing positions. 

3. **Anxiety-related syncope**: Given the patient’s recent stressors, anxiety-related syncope could also be a consideration. However, the specific trigger of getting dressed in the morning, along with the patient’s adaptive behavior to prevent injury, makes vasovagal syncope a more likely diagnosis.",Carotid hypersensitivity syndrome,Relevant.

37,"A 43-year-old Caucasian female with a long history of uncontrolled migraines presents to general medical clinic with painless hematuria. She is quite concerned because she has never had symptoms like this before. Vital signs are stable, and her physical examination is benign. She denies any groin pain, flank pain, or costovertebral angle tenderness. She denies any recent urinary tract infections or dysuria. Urinary analysis confirms hematuria and a serum creatinine returns at 3.0. A renal biopsy reveals papillary necrosis and a tubulointerstitial infiltrate. What is the most likely diagnosis?","*1* 1. Analgesic nephropathy: Analgesic nephropathy is a well-known cause of renal papillary necrosis and tubulointerstitial nephritis. This condition is commonly associated with long-term use and high-dose consumption of analgesics, particularly NSAIDs, which are commonly used for the treatment of migraines. The history of chronic migraines and imaging findings support this diagnosis.

*2* 2. Sickle cell disease: Sickle cell disease can cause renal papillary necrosis due to vaso-occlusion of the small vessels in the renal medulla. Patients with sickle cell disease may present with hematuria and a history of pain crises, but the absence of typical symptoms like flank pain in this patient makes it less likely.

*3* 3. Acute pyelonephritis: Acute pyelonephritis is characterized by upper urinary tract inflammation and can sometimes present with hematuria. However, the lack of classic symptoms such as fever, flank pain, or dysuria makes this diagnosis less likely in this case.",Analgesic nephropathy,Relevant.

39,"A 20-year-old man is brought to the behavioral health clinic by his roommate. The patient’s roommate says that the patient has been looking for cameras that aliens planted in their apartment for the past 2 weeks. Approximately 3 months prior to the onset of this episode, the roommate says the patient stopped playing basketball daily because the sport no longer interested him. He stayed in his bedroom most of the day and was often tearful. The roommate recalls the patient talking about death frequently. The patient states he has been skipping many meals and has lost a significant amount of weight as a result. At the time his delusions about the aliens began, the depressive-related symptoms were no longer present. He has no other medical conditions. He does not drink but smokes 2 packs of cigarettes daily for the past 5 years. His vitals include: blood pressure 130/88 mm Hg, pulse 92/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F).

Which of the following is the correct diagnosis?","*1* 1. Schizophreniform disorder: This condition is characterized by the presence of symptoms resembling schizophrenia, such as delusions, flat affect, and bizarre behavior, lasting between 1 and 6 months. The symptoms in this patient have been present for less than 6 months, making schizophrenia a less likely diagnosis.

*2* 2. Brief psychotic disorder: This diagnosis is considered when an individual develops psychotic symptoms that last for at least 1 day but less than 1 month, often in response to a significant stressor. The patient's symptoms have been present for more than 1 month, making brief psychotic disorder less likely.

*3* 3. Schizoaffective disorder: This diagnosis involves symptoms of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder, such as major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. However, since the depressive symptoms in this patient preceded the onset of the psychotic symptoms and are no longer present, schizoaffective disorder is less likely.",Schizoaffective disorder,Relevant.

Resuscitation is started with IV fluids and cross-matched blood arranged. His vitals are stabilized after resuscitation and blood transfusion. His hemoglobin is 7.6 g/dL, hematocrit is 30%, BUN is 33 mg/dL, and PT/aPTT is within normal limits. A nasogastric tube is inserted, which drains bile without blood. Rectal examination and proctoscopy reveal massive active bleeding, without any obvious hemorrhoids or fissure. The physician estimates the rate of bleeding at 2-3 mL/min. What is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?","*1* 1. Colonoscopy: Colonoscopy is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis for this patient presenting with massive rectal bleeding. Colonoscopy allows for visualization of the entire colon and can identify the source of bleeding, such as arteriovenous malformations, diverticula, or malignant lesions.

*2* 2. Angiography: Angiography may be considered if the source of bleeding is not identified on colonoscopy. Angiography can localize the site of bleeding and allow for potential intervention, such as embolization of a bleeding vessel.

*3* 3. Capsule endoscopy: Capsule endoscopy is not the most appropriate next step in this case because the patient is actively bleeding and hemodynamically unstable. Capsule endoscopy is non-invasive and may be considered in stable patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.",Mesenteric angiography,Relevant
42,"A 50-year-old man is brought to the hospital after being found unresponsive in his bed in the morning. He is declared dead on arrival in the emergency room. His wife states that he always had uncontrolled hypertension despite being on multiple medications. An autopsy is performed, and the cause of his death is found to be a hemorrhage in his right basal ganglia. On microscopic examination, the branches of the renal artery have concentric endothelial proliferation with prominent narrowing of the lumen resulting in focal ischemia and hemorrhage of the renal parenchyma. Which of the following is most likely related to the findings in this patient?","1. **Hypertensive nephrosclerosis**: Hypertension can cause damage to the renal vessels leading to changes like concentric endothelial proliferation and narrowing of the lumen, ultimately leading to renal parenchymal ischemia and hemorrhage.

2. **Uncontrolled hypertension**: Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to damage in small blood vessels throughout the body, including the kidneys, leading to similar findings as described in the autopsy.

3. **Renal artery stenosis**: This condition involves narrowing of the renal artery, which can lead to decreased blood flow to the kidney and subsequent ischemia. While it could potentially explain the kidney findings, it is less likely in this scenario than hypertensive nephrosclerosis given the patient's longstanding uncontrolled hypertension.",Raised renin level in the blood,Relevant.
