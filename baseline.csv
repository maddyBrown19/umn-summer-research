IgG: 470 mg/dL (Normal: 650-1500 mg/dL)
IgM: 29 mg/dL (Normal: 40-345 mg/dL)

What is the most likely diagnosis?","*1* The most likely diagnosis for this patient is Chronic Rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common inflammatory condition of the paranasal sinuses and nasal passages that typically persists for at least 12 weeks. It can be triggered by viral infections like the common cold, allergies, environmental factors, or anatomical abnormalities. The patient's symptoms of headache, sinus drainage, congestion, and cough lasting for over 2 weeks, along with a history of repeated episodes, are consistent with this diagnosis.

*2* Asthma exacerbation. Although the patient's asthma is reportedly well-controlled, exacerbations can still occur, especially in the setting of upper respiratory tract infections like CRS. The patient's presenting symptoms of cough and subjective fever may overlap with asthma exacerbation symptoms. It would be important to consider this diagnosis and ensure her asthma is optimally managed.

*3* Allergic Rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is another common condition that can present with similar symptoms to chronic rhinosinusitis. The patient's history of multiple episodes within the past year and the presence of asthma suggest an underlying allergic component.

Anti-HEV negative
What is the most common mode of transmission for this patient’s diagnosis?","1. *1* Fecal-oral route: Hepatitis A virus is most commonly transmitted through the fecal-oral route, often due to contaminated food or water. This is supported by the patient's symptoms of nausea, loss of appetite, and yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes.

2. *2* Close personal contact: Hepatitis A virus can also be spread through close personal contact with an infected individual, such as sharing utensils or engaging in sexual activity. However, the lack of mention of close contacts in the patient's history makes this less likely in this case.

3. *3* Vertical transmission: Hepatitis A virus can rarely be transmitted from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth. However, since the patient is a 25-year-old construction worker without any mention of recent childbirth, this mode of transmission is less likely in this scenario.",Fecal-oral,Relevant

Actinic keratosis is a precancerous lesion that appears as a rough, scaly patch on the skin, often on areas exposed to the sun like the face, hands, or arms. It is important to monitor and potentially treat actinic keratosis to prevent progression to skin cancer.

*2* 2. Seborrheic keratosis: Seborrheic keratosis is a common, non-cancerous skin growth seen in older adults. However, it typically presents as a waxy, stuck-on appearance with a more benign look compared to the rough, scaly plaque described in this case.

*3* 3. Squamous cell carcinoma: Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that also presents as a scaly, rough patch on the skin. It is important to consider this diagnosis in individuals with a history of sun exposure, like this patient. However, actinic keratosis is a more common precursor to squamous cell carcinoma and should initially be ruled out.",Actinic keratosis,Relevant.

*2* A complete blood count (CBC) may be considered as the second best option to rule out anemia, which can also present with fatigue, but the combination of symptoms and physical exam findings in this case points more towards hypothyroidism.

*3* A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) may be considered as the third option to assess for electrolyte abnormalities or kidney/liver dysfunction, but it is less likely to provide the primary cause of the patient's symptoms compared to a TSH level.",Serum TSH,Accurate
31,Under what physiologic state is the endogenous human analog of nesiritide produced?,"*1* The endogenous human analog of nesiritide is brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), which is mainly produced by the ventricles of the heart in response to increased stretching of the heart muscle cells.

*2* Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is also secreted in response to increased blood volume and pressure, both of which lead to increased strain on the heart.

*3* BNP levels are elevated in conditions such as heart failure, where the heart is under increased stress and strain, leading to the release of BNP to help regulate blood volume and pressure.",Increased ventricular stretch,Accurate.
