0,What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient with vomiting blood after drinking excessively at a college party?,"*1* The most likely diagnosis for this patient is a Mallory-Weiss tear. This condition is often caused by forceful or prolonged vomiting after excessive alcohol consumption. The tear occurs where the esophagus meets the stomach and can result in bleeding, leading to vomiting of blood.

*2* The second plausible diagnosis for the patient could be alcoholic gastritis. Excessive alcohol consumption can irritate the stomach lining, causing inflammation and potentially leading to bleeding, presenting as vomiting of blood.

*3* Another possible diagnosis for this patient could be a peptic ulcer. Chronic alcohol use can contribute to the development of peptic ulcers, which are sores that form on the lining of the stomach or duodenum. If the ulcer bleeds, it can cause vomiting of blood.",Mallory-Weiss tear,Relevant

Acute pancreatitis: The symptoms described, such as severe abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, and a history of recent heavy meal consumption, all suggest acute pancreatitis. The physical exam findings of a rigid abdomen and decreased or absent bowel sounds are also characteristic of this condition. The imaging findings of a main pancreatic duct stricture can further support the diagnosis.

2. Gallstones: Given that the patient had symptoms after a meal and the imaging revealed abnormalities in the pancreatic duct, gallstones could be a likely cause. Gallstones can obstruct the pancreatic duct, leading to pancreatitis. The appearance of ""baby forming"" on imaging could refer to the biliary tree, where the gallstones could be causing issues.

3. Cholecystitis: Inflammation of the gallbladder, known as cholecystitis, can present with similar symptoms as described by the patient. Although the description provided did not directly mention the gallbladder, the proximity of the gallbladder to the pancreas can sometimes lead to confusion in symptoms.

This could be due to various reasons such as hormonal imbalances, genetic factors, anatomical abnormalities, or conditions affecting the ovaries or uterus.

2. The patient's history of developing breasts four years ago but not experiencing any periods might indicate a problem with their reproductive system, such as a lack of ovulation. Further evaluation with hormone testing (FSH, LH, estradiol), pelvic ultrasound, and possibly genetic testing may be warranted to determine the cause.

3. It is important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing the absence of periods, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hypothalamic dysfunction, or congenital abnormalities.

A 45-year-old female presents with sudden onset of severe chest pain that radiates to her back. She is diaphoretic, nauseous, and hypotensive. When asked about her medical history, she reports a previous episode of chest pain that was relieved with rest. On examination, her blood pressure is 80/40 mmHg and her heart rate is 120 bpm.

**Top 3 Answers:**
1. **Aortic dissection**: This patient's presentation with sudden onset severe chest pain radiating to the back, along with hypotension, diaphoresis, and history of previous chest pain, is highly concerning for an aortic dissection. It is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate diagnosis and intervention.
2. **Myocardial infarction (MI)**: While an MI can present with chest pain and be associated with diaphoresis and nausea, the sudden onset severe pain radiating to the back and hypotension makes aortic dissection a more likely diagnosis in this case.
