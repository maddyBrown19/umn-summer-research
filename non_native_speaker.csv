She is very overweight and has trouble breathing with decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance in both lungs. Lab results show low oxygen levels. What could be causing her symptoms?","*1* This presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of a pulmonary embolism, which occurs when a blood clot travels to the lungs and blocks blood flow, leading to decreased oxygen levels and difficulty breathing. The patient's obesity is a risk factor for developing blood clots.

*2* Another possibility is a pneumothorax, where air gets trapped in the space between the lung and the chest wall, leading to hyperresonance on percussion and decreased breath sounds. This can cause difficulty in breathing and increased respiratory rate.

*3* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is also a possible cause, as it can present with low oxygen levels, high respiratory rate, and difficulty breathing. However, the hyperresonance and decreased breath sounds described in the scenario are less typical for ARDS.",Alveolar hypoventilation,Inaccurate

22,"So, five weeks after delivery, how is a small baby doing? He was born quite early at 26 weeks. Has the baby been needing help to breathe since he was born? What are the baby's vital signs right now? And what do the tests and the chest x-ray of the baby show? So, what do you think is the most likely diagnosis for the baby's condition?","1. The baby is likely doing better since being born at 26 weeks as the risks decrease with each passing week. However, the baby may still be at risk for complications due to prematurity such as respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, and developmental delays.

2. If the baby has been needing help to breathe since birth, it could indicate respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) due to prematurity. This would require close monitoring and potentially the need for oxygen support or mechanical ventilation.

3. The baby's vital signs should be within normal range for infants, including heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation levels, and temperature. Abnormal vital signs could indicate underlying issues such as infection or respiratory distress.

4. Tests and chest x-ray of the baby may show signs of lung immaturity, such as a reticulogranular pattern on chest x-ray, which is characteristic of RDS. Blood tests may also be done to check for infection, anemia, or other abnormalities.

5. The most likely diagnosis for the baby's condition is respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) due to prematurity. Other differential diagnoses could include chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia), infection, congenital anomalies, or other complications of prematurity.

Can you, um, tell me what's going on with her?","It is possible that the woman is experiencing postpartum headache, which is a common occurrence after giving birth. However, considering the potential seriousness of the symptoms and the timing postpartum, a few things should be considered:

1. Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH): This can occur as a complication of an epidural or spinal anesthesia given during childbirth. The classic presentation includes a headache that worsens when sitting or standing but improves when lying down. It is usually associated with symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and neck stiffness. The woman's symptoms and the timing after giving birth are consistent with PDPH, and her vital signs could also be affected by this condition.

2. Postpartum preeclampsia: The headache, along with elevated blood pressure, could be signs of postpartum preeclampsia. Although it typically occurs within the first 48 hours after delivery, it can manifest up to 6 weeks postpartum. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, protein in the urine, headaches, and sometimes visual disturbances.

3. Intracranial bleeding: While less common, an intracranial bleed could present with headache, changes in blood pressure, and other vital sign abnormalities. This should be considered, especially if the symptoms worsen or additional neurological symptoms develop.

Given the combination of symptoms and vital signs described, it is essential for the woman to seek medical attention promptly for a proper evaluation and management.",This patient’s condition can resolve on its own,Relevant
31,"Have you observed blood in your urine and been coughing up blood for the last three days, with a decrease in how often you urinate, and no pain when you urinate?","1. The most plausible explanation for these signs and symptoms is a urinary tract infection (UTI) that has spread to the kidneys (pyelonephritis). The presence of blood in the urine (hematuria), decreased frequency of urination, coughing up blood (hemoptysis), and lack of urinary pain can all be consistent with a severe UTI involving the kidneys.
  
2. Another possible explanation could be a kidney stone that has caused damage to the kidney or ureter, leading to blood in the urine and decreased urine output. The coughing up of blood may be coincidental or related to another condition, such as bronchitis or pneumonia.

Um, she has a, a history of anorexia nervosa. Um, her husband, um, brought her to the doctor. Um, which medicine could help her, um, with her mood and also, um, help her gain weight?","*1* 1. Mirtazapine: Mirtazapine is an antidepressant that can help improve mood and increase appetite, leading to weight gain. It is often used in patients with depression and weight loss.

*2* 2. Olanzapine: Olanzapine is an antipsychotic medication that is also known to increase appetite and promote weight gain. It can be helpful in managing symptoms of depression and anxiety.

*3* 3. Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly used to treat depression. While it may improve mood, it is less likely to cause weight gain compared to Mirtazapine and Olanzapine.",Mirtazapine,Relevant
39,"A 50-year-old man, he goes to the emergency room, you know, because he sees blood in his stool. He says this morning he saw bright red blood in the toilet, you know? He doesn't feel tired, no headaches, not losing weight, no heart pounding, and no poop problems. He has high blood pressure, takes hydrochlorothiazide. His dad has arthritis, and his mom has Graves' disease. His temperature is 98°F, blood pressure is 128/78, pulse 70. He looks healthy. Doctors don't find where the blood is coming from, even with a butt check. The poop blood test is positive. What test should they do first to check for cancer?","1. Colonoscopy: A colonoscopy is the gold standard for evaluating the colon and rectum for any abnormal growths or signs of cancer. It allows direct visualization of the colon, tissue sampling, and potential removal of precancerous or cancerous lesions.

2. Flexible sigmoidoscopy: This procedure allows visualization of the distal part of the colon and rectum. While not as comprehensive as a colonoscopy, it can still help detect abnormalities in this area.

3. Fecal occult blood test (FOBT): This test detects hidden blood in the stool, which could be a sign of colorectal cancer or other gastrointestinal issues. While it can help identify blood in the stool, further evaluation with a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy would be needed for definitive diagnosis.",Colonoscopy,Accurate.

41,A 57-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of shortness of breath and palpitations for 3 hours. He has had similar episodes intermittently for 4 months. His pulse is 140/min and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. An ECG shows irregular narrow-complex tachycardia with no discernible P waves. Emergent electrical cardioversion is performed and the patient reverts to normal sinus rhythm. Pharmacotherapy with sotalol is begun. What is the most likely physiologic effect of this drug?,"*1* The most likely physiologic effect of sotalol is the prolongation of the action potential duration of cardiac tissue. This is mainly due to its class III antiarrhythmic properties, which are characterized by blocking the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr), leading to lengthening of the repolarization phase of the action potential and refractoriness, therefore reducing the risk of reentrant arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.

*2* Another effect of sotalol is the non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, which can lead to negative chronotropic and inotropic effects on the heart, reducing heart rate and contractility.

*3* Sotalol can also produce a mild degree of alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade, leading to vasodilation and potential reductions in blood pressure.",Decreased AV nodal conduction,Relevant
42,Can you tell me if she is experiencing any numbness or tingling in her legs or feet?,"*1* The patient may be experiencing peripheral neuropathy, which can cause numbness and tingling in the legs and feet. This condition is often a result of nerve damage and can be caused by diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, infections, or other medical conditions.

*2* Another possibility is that the patient may be experiencing poor circulation, which can lead to numbness and tingling in the lower extremities. Conditions such as peripheral artery disease can restrict blood flow to the legs and feet, causing these symptoms.

*3* It is also important to consider the possibility of sciatica, which occurs when the sciatic nerve is compressed or irritated. This can cause numbness, tingling, or pain that radiates from the lower back down one or both legs.",Increased deep tendon reflexes,Relevant
43,"Can you please tell me what is the best first thing to do now for the lady with sickle cell disease who is having trouble breathing and chest pain, despite taking ibuprofen? I see that her temperature is 38.2°C, blood pressure is 112/71 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and oxygen level is 91%.","*1* The best first thing to do for the lady with sickle cell disease who is having trouble breathing and chest pain, despite taking ibuprofen, with a temperature of 38.2°C, blood pressure of 112/71 mm Hg, pulse of 105/min, and oxygen level of 91% would be to administer oxygen therapy.

*2* The second best thing to do would be to provide intravenous fluids to help improve circulation and oxygen delivery to tissues.

*3* The third best thing to do would be to monitor her closely for any signs of further deterioration and inform the healthcare provider immediately.",Antibiotics and supportive care,Relevant
44,"Why boy's pee look like tea and face puffy? Fever and sore throat before, took ibuprofen. Born at 39 weeks. Heart rate 100, respiratory 22, BP 130/80, temp 36.8°C. Puffy eyes, pee has protein and dysmorphic red cells. Why boy have high blood pressure, face swollen, and weird pee?","*1* 1. The most likely diagnosis in this scenario is acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. This is a condition that can occur after a streptococcal infection (such as a sore throat) and typically presents with tea-colored urine due to the presence of blood, along with swelling of the face and eyes (puffy face), proteinuria, and high blood pressure. The presence of red blood cells in the urine (dysmorphic red cells) is also a characteristic feature.

*2* 2. Nephrotic syndrome is also a plausible explanation given the proteinuria and puffy face. However, the history of a recent sore throat and the presence of dysmorphic red cells in the urine make poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis the more likely diagnosis.

*3* 3. Acute interstitial nephritis could also be considered given the history of taking ibuprofen which can cause adverse kidney effects. However, the clinical presentation with tea-colored urine, puffy face, proteinuria, and high blood pressure make acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis a more suitable choice in this case.",Immune complex deposition,Relevant.
45,"So, um, the little boy is, uh, really sick with, uh, bad pain in his belly and thighs, right? His mom says she has the same, uh, sickness. Um, the boy's heart beats fast, and his blood pressure is, uh, 100 over 55. His temperature is 100.2, and he breathes 20 times per minute. His blood test shows he has low, um, blood and too many white cells. The mom wants to know if there's, uh, anything that can help her son, um, in the long run. Um, so, what can, uh, make these episodes happen less often and be not as bad?","1. The most plausible answer is Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). FMF is an inherited autoinflammatory disorder that commonly presents with episodes of fever and severe abdominal pain. These episodes can be debilitating but can be managed with medications such as colchicine to prevent and reduce the severity of the attacks.

2. The second best answer is Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that can cause a wide range of symptoms, including joint pain, skin rashes, and inflammation in various organs. Although not as common in children, it can present with abdominal pain, fever, and a rapid heart rate. Treatment typically involves medications to suppress the immune system.

3. The third best answer is Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), which includes conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Treatment usually involves medications to reduce inflammation and manage symptoms.",Hydroxyurea,Inaccurate.
46,"Could it be...um, maybe...what else should...um, she take besides...uh, those antibiotics?","1. Probiotics: Taking probiotics can help restore the healthy bacteria in the gut that may have been affected by the antibiotics.
2. Plenty of water: Staying well-hydrated can help flush out the antibiotics from the system and prevent dehydration.
3. Rest: Getting plenty of rest allows the body to focus on fighting the infection and recover properly.",Vaccination to induce a B-cell response with moderate level affinity antibodies,Inaccurate.
47,"A 36-year-old... um... first-time pregnant woman goes to see her... um... lady doctor during the... um... 28th week of her pregnancy. The doctor... um... finds swelling around her... um... ankles and high blood pressure. A... um... test on her pee collected for 24 hours shows... um... 4 grams of protein. If she doesn't get treatment, what's her... um... biggest risk?","*1* The patient's biggest risk in this scenario is developing preeclampsia, a potentially serious pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure, swelling, and protein in the urine. If left untreated, preeclampsia can lead to severe complications for both the mother and the baby, including seizures (eclampsia), stroke, organ damage, and even death.

*2* Another significant risk for the patient is the development of HELLP syndrome, a variant of severe preeclampsia. HELLP syndrome is a serious condition that involves hemolysis (the breakdown of red blood cells), elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count. It can lead to complications such as liver rupture, stroke, and maternal and fetal death if not promptly treated.

*3* Untreated preeclampsia can also result in restricted fetal growth or development (intrauterine growth restriction) due to compromised blood flow to the placenta. This can lead to premature birth, low birth weight, and potential long-term health issues for the baby.",Hemolysis,relevant
48,"Uh, what uh...happens if uh, a gene that helps make uh, a part of the uh, throat in a baby uh, is missing? Like, what uh, might doctors uh, see in the baby uh, after it's born?","1. The most plausible answer would be that the baby could be born with a condition called Pierre Robin sequence, where the lower jaw is small and causes the tongue to fall back in the throat, obstructing the airway. This can lead to breathing difficulties and feeding problems.

2. Another possibility could be a cleft palate, where the roof of the baby's mouth does not form properly, causing a hole between the nose and mouth. This can also lead to feeding difficulties and an increased risk of ear infections.

3. A third possibility could be a condition called laryngomalacia, where the tissue above the vocal cords is floppy and falls into the airway when the baby breathes in. This can cause noisy breathing, difficulty feeding, and in severe cases, breathing problems.",White oral patches,Inaccurate.
49,Is there something wrong with the baby's breathing? (pause)他有什么症状?,"*1* Possible respiratory issues in a baby can include respiratory infections such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, as well as respiratory distress syndrome in premature babies.
*2* Obstructive issues such as airway malformations or foreign body aspiration can cause breathing difficulties in babies.
*3* Other possibilities include congenital heart defects or neurological conditions affecting breathing control.",Defective CD40 ligand,Inaccurate
