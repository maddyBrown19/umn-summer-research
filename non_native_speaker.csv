The liver is responsible for processing bilirubin, a waste product from the breakdown of red blood cells. When the liver is not functioning properly, bilirubin can build up in the body and cause yellowing of the skin and eyes.
2. Gallbladder disease: Jaundice can also occur as a result of a blockage in the bile ducts, which can be caused by conditions such as gallstones or inflammation of the gallbladder. This obstruction prevents the normal flow of bile from the liver to the intestines, leading to a buildup of bilirubin in the body.

What is most likely diagnosis?","1. **Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)**: This is the most likely diagnosis for a premature infant who has required respiratory support since birth and is now presenting with difficulty breathing, abnormal lung sounds, and abnormalities on chest x-ray. BPD is a common lung disease in premature babies, particularly those born at less than 28 weeks gestation, and is characterized by chronic lung inflammation and scarring.

2. **Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)**: RDS is a condition common in premature babies who lack a substance called surfactant, which helps keep the small air sacs in the lungs from collapsing. It can present with similar symptoms as BPD, but is more acute and typically improves with surfactant replacement therapy.

3. **Pneumonia**: Infection of the lungs causing inflammation and fluid buildup can also present with these symptoms. However, given the history of prematurity and ongoing respiratory support, BPD or RDS are more likely diagnoses.",Bronchopulmonary dysplasia,Relevant

The doctor sees redness on her nose, chin, and inner cheeks with a few small bumps and visible blood vessels. There are no blackheads or blisters. Everything else seems normal. Apart from changing her behavior, what should be the first treatment option?""","*1* 1. Rosacea: The patient's symptoms of redness on the nose, cheeks, and chin with visible blood vessels and small bumps are consistent with rosacea, a chronic skin condition that commonly affects adults. The triggers for flare-ups, such as sun exposure, alcohol, and stress, as well as the lack of itchiness or pain, are also suggestive of rosacea. The first treatment option for rosacea would typically involve topical medications like metronidazole or azelaic acid to reduce redness and inflammation.

*3* 2. Lupus: Although lupus can present with facial redness as a symptom, the lack of systemic symptoms, like joint pain, fatigue, or other organ involvement, makes it less likely in this case. It's worth considering due to the family history, so further investigation may be warranted if other symptoms develop.

*2* 3. Acne: While the patient's sister has acne, the absence of blackheads or typical acne lesions like whiteheads or pustules makes acne less likely. Acne also typically presents with comedones in addition to redness, which are not mentioned in the patient's case.",Topical metronidazole,Relevant

Her headache gets worse when she sits up or stands and gets better when she lies down. Taking acetaminophen and ibuprofen helps a bit with the pain. She does not have a fever. Her vital signs are: pulse 100/min, breathing rate 18/min, and blood pressure 128/84 mm Hg. Which of the following sentences is the most correct about the woman's health at this time?","*1* The most likely cause of the woman's headache and neck pain is a post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) following the administration of an epidural. This occurs when there is a leakage of cerebrospinal fluid through the puncture site in the dura mater, leading to decreased intracranial pressure and resulting in a headache that worsens with sitting or standing and improves with lying down. Taking acetaminophen and ibuprofen can provide some relief.

*2* Another possibility could be a tension headache due to the stress of childbirth and postpartum recovery. Tension headaches are usually described as a band-like sensation of pressure around the head, neck, and behind the eyes. The headache may worsen with stress and improve with rest.

*3* Lastly, it is always important to consider the possibility of a preeclampsia-related headache, especially since the woman is postpartum. Preeclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys. While the woman's blood pressure is slightly elevated, it is still within the normal range. However, a thorough evaluation should be done to rule out preeclampsia as it can present with headaches, visual changes, and other symptoms.",This patient’s condition can resolve on its own,Relevant

Physical exam is normal. Besides therapy, what medication would be best for this patient?","*1*  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - Given the patient's symptoms of anxiety, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping along with symptoms of erectile dysfunction, an SSRI like sertraline or escitalopram can be highly effective in treating generalized anxiety disorder and improving symptoms of insomnia. SSRIs are considered first-line treatment for anxiety disorders and are also effective for depression, which can commonly coexist with anxiety.

*2*  Buspirone - Buspirone is a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic that is commonly used to treat generalized anxiety disorder. It works by affecting serotonin and dopamine receptors in the brain. Buspirone is often chosen as an alternative to SSRIs for patients who do not tolerate SSRIs well or have concerns about side effects.

*3*  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - Therapy is a crucial part of treating anxiety disorders and can be just as effective as medication, especially for long-term management and prevention of relapse.

37,Is there a reason for the swelling in your legs and feeling tired lately? Have you also been coughing a lot and finding it hard to breathe?,"1. The patient may be experiencing symptoms of congestive heart failure, which can cause swelling in the legs (edema) and fatigue due to the heart's inability to pump blood effectively. The coughing and difficulty breathing may also be signs of fluid buildup in the lungs (pulmonary edema) associated with heart failure.

2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) could also be a cause of the symptoms described. COPD can lead to chronic coughing, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Swelling in the legs (peripheral edema) can occur in advanced stages of COPD due to the strain on the heart.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is another possibility, especially if there is localized swelling in one leg. DVT can cause swelling and discomfort in the affected leg, along with fatigue. If a blood clot breaks loose and travels to the lungs, it can lead to coughing and difficulty breathing (pulmonary embolism).",Cystic fibrosis,Inaccurate.
