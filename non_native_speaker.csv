The horizontal nystagmus (involuntary eye movements) is a key finding in BPPV.

*2* Another plausible explanation could be Meniere's disease, a condition of the inner ear that causes episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, and ringing in the ears. However, Meniere's disease typically presents with more constant symptoms rather than brief, positional vertigo episodes.

*3* Vestibular migraine is also a possibility, given the sudden onset of vertigo and false sense of movement, but this condition is usually associated with a history of migraine headaches, which is not mentioned in the case description.",Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV),Relevant
