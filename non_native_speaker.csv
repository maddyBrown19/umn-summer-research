22,"What is the cardiac output of the person who is having their heart function tested and they are 40 years old, a lady, no heart problems before, doesn't take any medicine, and is at rest? They checked her blood and found her hemoglobin to be 14 g/dL, and her arterial oxygen content to be 0.22 mL O2/mL with a saturation of 98%, her venous oxygen content is 0.17 mL O2/mL with a saturation of 78%, and her oxygen consumption is 250 mL/min. Her pulse is 75 beats per minute, her breathing rate is 14 breaths per minute, and her blood pressure is 125/70 mm Hg.","1. The cardiac output can be estimated using the Fick principle which states that cardiac output equals the oxygen consumption divided by the arterial-venous oxygen difference. So, CO = VO2 / (CaO2 - CvO2) = 250 mL/min / (0.22 - 0.17) = 1250 mL/min or 5 L/min. Therefore, the cardiac output of this person at rest is approximately 5 L/min.
  
2. The cardiac output can also be calculated using the formula CO = HR x SV, where CO is cardiac output, HR is heart rate, and SV is stroke volume. Given that the heart rate is 75 beats per minute, and assuming a normal stroke volume, the cardiac output would be 5 L/min.
