1. **Tamsulosin** - Tamsulosin is a medication commonly used to treat symptoms of an enlarged prostate, such as difficulty urinating or weak urine flow. In this case, the patient's symptoms of a big lump near the top of the stomach and difficulty urinating could be due to an enlarged prostate or other urinary obstruction. Tamsulosin works by relaxing the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, allowing for easier urination.

2. **Oxybutynin** - Oxybutynin is a medication that helps control an overactive bladder, which can cause symptoms like frequent urination, urgency, and incontinence. If the patient's bladder muscles are squeezing at the same time and resulting in difficulty urinating, oxybutynin could be beneficial in reducing these symptoms.

3. **Silodosin** - Silodosin is another medication used to treat symptoms of an enlarged prostate, specifically in men with conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Similar to tamsulosin, it helps relax the muscles in the prostate and bladder to improve urinary flow and reduce symptoms of urinary obstruction.",Prazosin,Inaccurate
