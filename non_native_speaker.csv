The horizontal nystagmus (involuntary eye movements) is a key finding in BPPV.

*2* Another plausible explanation could be Meniere's disease, a condition of the inner ear that causes episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, and ringing in the ears. However, Meniere's disease typically presents with more constant symptoms rather than brief, positional vertigo episodes.
