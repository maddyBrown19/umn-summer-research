She didn't get prenatal check-ups because she doesn't have health insurance. After giving birth, her new baby looks yellow and has a visibly large liver and spleen. The baby's hemoglobin level is 11.6 g/dL and bilirubin level is 8 mg/dL. What do these details suggest about the baby's likely condition?","1. The details suggest that the baby likely has *1* Congenital infection, such as congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) or toxoplasmosis. These infections can cause hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen) and jaundice in newborns.

2. The details indicate a possibility of *2* Hemolytic disease of the newborn, such as ABO or Rh incompatibility. This condition can lead to jaundice, anemia, and an enlarged liver and spleen in newborns.

3. The details may also indicate a potential diagnosis of *3* Biliary atresia. Although less common, biliary atresia can present with jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated bilirubin levels in newborns.",The mother generated IgG antibodies against fetal red blood cells,Relevant
43,"Can you tell me what might be causing shoulder pain in a 65-year-old woman who experiences discomfort when reaching for things in her kitchen cabinets, even though she hasn't had any significant injuries?","1. The most plausible cause of the shoulder pain in this 65-year-old woman is **rotator cuff tendinitis**. This condition involves inflammation or irritation of the tendons of the rotator cuff, which can be exacerbated by reaching or lifting movements, such as reaching for items in kitchen cabinets.

2. Another possible cause could be **shoulder impingement syndrome**. This occurs when the rotator cuff tendons or bursa are pinched or compressed in the shoulder joint, leading to pain and discomfort with overhead movements like reaching for objects.

3. A third possible cause could be **osteoarthritis of the shoulder joint**, which is a degenerative condition that can cause pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion in the shoulder. While this condition may not have been directly caused by an injury, it can worsen with certain movements like reaching up to high shelves.",Rotator cuff tendinopathy,Relevant
44,"A 33-year-old woman goes to her regular doctor because she feels tired and queasy. She also noticed that her skin looks darker than before. During the check-up, the doctor sees that she looks a bit yellow, and after some tests, finds out her liver enzymes are high. More tests confirm she has hepatitis B. She's really worried about passing this on to her family. How can hepatitis B spread? Through blood, sexual contact, from mother to baby, and/or through breast milk?","*1* Hepatitis B can be spread through blood. This can happen through sharing needles, syringes, or other equipment used to inject drugs, through needlesticks or sharps exposures on the job, or from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth.

*2* Hepatitis B can be spread through sexual contact. Having unprotected sex with an infected person can increase the risk of getting Hepatitis B.

*3* Hepatitis B can also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth. This is the reason why babies born to infected mothers are given the Hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Hepatitis B is not typically spread through breast milk, unless there are cracks or bleeding in the mother's nipples.","I, II, III, IV",Relevant
45,My 3-year-old daughter isn't acting like other kids her age since starting daycare. She ignores her name and only wants to play with the train set. Is this normal or should we be concerned?,"*1* It is possible that your daughter is exhibiting symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Symptoms of ASD can start to appear around 2 to 3 years of age, and include characteristics like social challenges, repetitive behaviors, and language delays.
*2* Another consideration could be attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which can also present with symptoms such as difficulty paying attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. However, typically ADHD symptoms are more noticeable in multiple environments, not just at daycare.
*3* Lastly, it is important to consider that transitioning to daycare can be a significant change for a child, and it is normal for them to exhibit some behaviors like increased clinginess, difficulty separating from parents, or showing different preferences in play. Observing over a longer period and discussing with her teachers about her behavior may provide more insight.",Autism spectrum disorder,Relevant
46,The question would be: Why did the man's heart show thickening of the left ventricular wall and narrowing of the ventricular chamber after being hit by a car and later dying from severe intracranial hemorrhage?,"*1* The man's left ventricular wall showed thickening and narrowing of the ventricular chamber due to broken heart syndrome (stress-induced cardiomyopathy) triggered by the severe stress of being hit by a car and the subsequent intracranial hemorrhage.

*2* The thickening of the left ventricular wall and narrowing of the ventricular chamber could also be attributed to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a condition where the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, making it harder for the heart to pump blood.

*3* Another possible cause could be myocardial infarction (heart attack) resulting from the severe physical trauma caused by being hit by a car, leading to damage to the heart muscle and subsequent thickening and narrowing of the left ventricular wall.",Chronic hypertension,Relevant
47,"Can you help me understand what might be going on with a woman who suddenly gained weight, has irregular periods, high blood pressure, and some unusual skin changes?","*1* The top plausible answer for these symptoms in a woman could be Cushing's syndrome. This condition is caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of the hormone cortisol, which can lead to weight gain (especially in the face, upper back, and abdomen), irregular periods, high blood pressure, and changes in the skin such as thinning, easy bruising, and purple stretch marks.

*2* The second plausible answer could be polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This common condition is characterized by hormonal imbalances that can cause weight gain, irregular periods, and skin changes such as acne and darkening of the skin.

*3* The third plausible answer could be hypothyroidism. This condition occurs when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone, leading to weight gain, irregular periods, high blood pressure, and changes in the skin such as dryness and puffiness.",Bilateral hyperplasia of the zona fasciculata,Relevant
48,Why does the newborn baby turn blue when crying and get tired and sweaty while feeding?,"*1* The newborn baby may be experiencing an episode of cyanotic breath-holding spell, a condition characterized by a brief period of shallow breathing followed by a prolonged pause in breathing. During these episodes, the baby may briefly turn blue due to decreased oxygen levels, and may also exhibit fatigue and sweating. This condition is usually benign and tends to resolve on its own as the baby grows older.

*2* Another possibility could be a cardiac issue such as Tetralogy of Fallot, a rare congenital heart defect that can cause a baby to turn blue (cyanosis) due to inadequate oxygen levels in the blood. This condition may also lead to fatigue and sweating, particularly during feeding or crying when the heart has to work harder.

*3* It is also important to consider a respiratory issue such as bronchiolitis, a common viral infection that affects the small airways in the lungs. Bronchiolitis can cause difficulty breathing, leading to decreased oxygen levels in the blood, which may result in a blue discoloration of the skin. Fatigue and sweating can also be present due to the increased effort of breathing during feeding or crying.",Degree of right ventricular outflow obstruction,Relevant
49,"A month after back surgery for a spinal cord injury, a 68-year-old man is experiencing lower belly pain. He hasn't peed since yesterday and has a bulge above his pubic bone with reduced feeling below his belly button. Tests show simultaneous muscle contractions in the bladder and urethra. Draining 900 mL of pee with a catheter. What's the best medicine for his pee issues?","*1* The best medicine for his urine retention issues would be Bethanechol, a medication that helps stimulate bladder contractions and improve urinary flow. 

*2* Another possible medication option could be Tolterodine, which is a medication used to treat overactive bladder by relaxing the bladder muscles and reducing urge incontinence. 

*3* Finally, Oxybutynin could also be considered as it helps relax the bladder muscles and can improve urinary symptoms.",Prazosin,Relevant
