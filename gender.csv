2,"A 55-year-old individual presents to their family physician with a 1-week history of dizziness. They experience spinning sensations whenever they lie down and these sensations increase when they turn their head to the right. These episodes are transient, intermittent, last for less than a minute, occur multiple times in a day, and are associated with nausea. Between the episodes, they are fine and are able to perform their routine activities. They deny fever, hearing disturbances, diplopia, tinnitus, and recent flu or viral illness. Past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. They do not use tobacco or alcohol. Their blood pressure is 124/78 mm Hg, the heart rate is 79/min, and the respiratory rate is 13/min. During the examination, when they are asked to lie supine from a sitting position with their head rotated towards the right side at 45°, horizontal nystagmus is observed. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?","*1* The most plausible diagnosis for this patient is Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is characterized by brief episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position and is often associated with the presence of nystagmus on positional testing. The next best step in the management of this patient would be to perform the Epley maneuver, a series of head maneuvers designed to reposition the displaced otoliths in the inner ear that are responsible for the vertigo symptoms.

*2* A second possible diagnosis for this patient could be vestibular migraine. Vestibular migraine is a type of migraine that presents with episodes of vertigo or dizziness. Given the individual's history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, further evaluation and management for vestibular migraine may be warranted, including lifestyle modifications, stress reduction techniques, and possibly medication for migraine prevention.

*3* Another possible diagnosis to consider in this patient is Meniere's disease. Meniere's disease is characterized by recurrent episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and a sensation of fullness in the affected ear. However, the absence of hearing disturbances and the presence of nystagmus on positional testing make BPPV a more likely diagnosis in this case. If symptoms persist despite Epley maneuver and there is concern for Meniere's disease, further evaluation with audiometry and vestibular function testing may be considered.",Reassurance and vestibular suppressants,Relevant

Acromegaly results from the overproduction of growth hormone by the pituitary gland, leading to excess growth and other systemic manifestations. The increased growth hormone can also lead to other cardiovascular and metabolic complications.

*2* Hypertension: Patients with acromegaly are at an increased risk of developing hypertension due to the direct effects of excess growth hormone on the cardiovascular system. Hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with acromegaly and requires close monitoring and management.

*3* Diabetes mellitus: Chronic excess levels of growth hormone in acromegaly can lead to insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism, increasing the risk of developing diabetes mellitus.

10,"A surgeon is interested in studying how different surgical techniques impact the healing of tendon injuries. In particular, they will compare 3 different types of suture repairs biomechanically in order to determine the maximum load before failure of the tendon 2 weeks after repair. They collect data on maximum load for 90 different repaired tendons from an animal model. Thirty tendons were repaired using each of the different suture techniques. Which of the following statistical measures is most appropriate for analyzing the results of this study?","*1* One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) - ANOVA would be the most appropriate statistical measure for comparing the maximum load before failure of tendons repaired using different suture techniques. ANOVA is specifically designed for comparing three or more groups to determine if there are statistically significant differences between the means.

*2* t-tests - While t-tests can compare the means of two groups, they are not ideal for comparing more than two groups simultaneously. In this study, the surgeon is comparing three different suture techniques, which would make ANOVA a more appropriate choice.

*3* Pearson correlation - Pearson correlation is used to assess the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two continuous variables. In this study, the surgeon is not interested in assessing the relationship between variables but rather comparing the means of different groups, making ANOVA a more suitable option.",ANOVA,accurate
11,"A 30-year-old individual presents to your clinic complaining of excessive thirst and frequent urination for the past few months. Urine testing reveals a low urine osmolarity, which fails to increase after subjecting the patient to a water deprivation test and injection of desmopressin. Further into the encounter, the patient reveals that they have been on a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder for several years. Which of the following is the most likely cause of their polyuria?","*1* Central diabetes insipidus is the most likely cause of polyuria in this patient. The history of excessive thirst and frequent urination, along with the low urine osmolarity and failure to concentrate urine in response to water deprivation and desmopressin injection, are all classic features of central diabetes insipidus. The use of a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder could also be a potential cause of central diabetes insipidus.

*2* Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is another possible cause of polyuria in this patient. However, the inability to concentrate urine in response to desmopressin supports central diabetes insipidus as the more likely diagnosis in this case.

*3* Psychogenic polydipsia could also present with excessive thirst and polyuria; however, the low urine osmolarity and failure to concentrate urine after desmopressin administration make central diabetes insipidus a more likely diagnosis in this patient.",Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,Relevant.

18,"At 3 weeks old, a baby has non-bilious projectile vomiting that occurred after feeding, is still hungry after vomiting, appears dehydrated and malnourished, and has a firm, “olive-like” mass of about 1.5 cm in diameter palpated in the right upper quadrant, by the lateral edge of the rectus abdominus muscle. On laboratory testing, the baby is found to have a hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?","1. *Pyloric stenosis*: Pyloric stenosis is the most likely cause of these symptoms in a 3-week-old baby. The classic presentation includes non-bilious projectile vomiting, persistent hunger, failure to thrive, dehydration, and a palpable “olive-like” mass in the right upper quadrant. The metabolic alkalosis with hypochloremia and hypokalemia seen in laboratory testing is also typical of pyloric stenosis.

2. *Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)*: GERD can present with vomiting after feeding, but it is usually not projectile and typically improves with age as the lower esophageal sphincter strengthens. The presence of the palpable mass in the right upper quadrant makes pyloric stenosis a more likely diagnosis in this case.

3. *Intestinal obstruction*: Intestinal obstruction can present with vomiting, abdominal distension, and a palpable mass. However, the fact that the vomiting is projectile and occurs after feeding, along with the specific findings of a “olive-like” mass in the right upper quadrant, are more suggestive of pyloric stenosis in this case.",Hypertrophy of the pylorus muscle,Relevant.
19,"A 23-year-old patient presents to the emergency department complaining of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The patient has a 10-year history of type I diabetes mellitus treated with lispro and glargine. Upon questioning, they mention that they stopped taking their insulin 3 days ago due to recent malaise and decreased appetite. They deny recent weight change, illicit drug use, or sexual activity. They do not take any other medications and they do not use tobacco products or alcohol. Upon physical examination the patient is afebrile. Their blood pressure is 105/70 mm Hg, pulse is 108/min and respiratory rate is 25/min. They appear lethargic, with clear breath sounds bilateral and a soft, nontender and nondistended abdomen. Laboratory results are as follows:
Sodium 130 mEq/L
Potassium 5.6 mEq/L
Chloride 91 mEq/L
Bicarbonate 12 mEq/L
Glucose 450 mg/dL
Which of the following is most likely to be found in this patient?","*1* Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's history of type I diabetes mellitus, high blood glucose level, and metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate level) are consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient's poor glycemic control due to stopping insulin can lead to the breakdown of fats, resulting in the production of ketones causing metabolic acidosis.

*2* Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium level is likely due to the metabolic acidosis from diabetic ketoacidosis which causes a shift of potassium out of the cells. However, in DKA, total body potassium is usually depleted, so despite the hyperkalemia on labs, the patient may actually be deficit in potassium.

*3* Hyponatremia: Hyponatremia is present in the patient, which may be due to hyperglycemia in this case. Hyperglycemia in DKA causes an osmotic diuresis, leading to loss of free water and subsequent hyponatremia.",Total body potassium depletion,Relevant

Physical examination reveals a 3.3 cm (1.2 in) lesion overlying their left elbow with an erythematous border, covered with a silver scale. What type of lesion is on the patient’s elbow?","*1*  Plaque psoriasis: This description is classic for plaque psoriasis, which presents as well-demarcated, erythematous, indurated plaques with overlying silver or white scale. The patient's past medical history of psoriasis is also highly suggestive.

*2*  Nummular eczema: Nummular eczema presents as coin-shaped (nummular), red, scaly patches on the skin. However, plaque psoriasis is more likely in this case given the patient's history of psoriasis.

*3*  Tinea corporis (ringworm): Tinea corporis can present as circular, erythematous, scaly plaques on the skin, mimicking other conditions like plaque psoriasis. However, the presence of silver scale and past medical history of psoriasis make this less likely in this case.",Plaque,Relevant

What is the best next step in the management of this patient?","*1* The best next step in the management of this patient would be to perform a rapid streptococcal antigen test (rapid strep test) or throat culture to confirm the presence of group A Streptococcus. Strep throat is a common bacterial infection that can present with sore throat, fever, and tonsillar exudate. The definitive diagnosis of strep throat is made by testing a throat swab for the presence of group A Streptococcus bacteria. Treatment with antibiotics is indicated for confirmed cases of strep throat to prevent potential complications and shorten the duration of symptoms.

*2* Another plausible option would be to manage the patient symptomatically with over-the-counter pain relievers, warm salt water gargles, throat lozenges, and plenty of fluids. Symptomatic management can help alleviate discomfort while awaiting test results or in cases where antibiotics may not be indicated (e.g., viral pharyngitis).

*3* It may also be considered to perform a Monospot test to rule out infectious mononucleosis, as this viral infection can also present with a sore throat, fever, and fatigue. However, given the presence of purulent tonsillar exudate, testing for streptococcal pharyngitis would be a more appropriate initial step.",Perform rapid antigen detection test,Accurate.

Their mother has autoimmune thyroid disease and Crohn disease. They are 150 cm (4 ft 11 in) tall and weigh 43 kg (95 lb); BMI is 19.1 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a wide-based gait. Muscle strength and tone are normal in all extremities. Rapid alternating movement of the hands is impaired. The abdomen is soft, and there is mild tenderness to palpation in the epigastric area. Their hemoglobin concentration is 11.1 mg/dL, and levels of vitamin E and vitamin D are decreased. Upper endoscopy shows several ulcers in the gastric antrum and the descending duodenum. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?","1. **Celiac Disease**: This patient's presentation is suggestive of celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten intake in genetically susceptible individuals. Symptoms can vary widely and can include fatigue, weight loss, diarrhea, and nutrient deficiencies due to malabsorption. The ulcers seen on upper endoscopy can be due to the inflammation and damage to the small intestine caused by the immune response to gluten.

2. **Autoimmune Gastritis**: Given the history of autoimmune thyroid disease in the family and the presence of ulcers in the stomach, autoimmune gastritis is a possible underlying mechanism. This condition is characterized by autoantibodies targeting the parietal cells in the stomach, leading to decreased production of intrinsic factor (needed for vitamin B12 absorption) and hydrochloric acid, resulting in malabsorption of nutrients.

3. **Whipple Disease**: This is less likely in this case, as Whipple disease typically presents with joint pain, fevers, and neurological symptoms in addition to gastrointestinal symptoms. It is caused by the bacteria Tropheryma whipplei and can lead to malabsorption due to damage to the small intestine.",Inactivation of pancreatic enzymes,Relevant

34,"A 55-year-old individual with diabetes presents to the emergency department due to swelling of their left leg, fever, and chills for the past 2 days. The individual’s maximum recorded temperature at home was 38.3°C (101.0°F). Their left leg is red and swollen from the ankle to the calf, with an ill-defined edge. Their vital signs include: blood pressure 120/78 mm Hg, pulse rate 94/min, temperature 38.3°C (101.0°F), and respiratory rate 16/min. On physical examination, the left leg shows marked tenderness and warmth compared with the right leg. The left inguinal lymph node is enlarged to 3 x 3 cm. Which of the following chemical mediators is the most likely cause of the individual’s fever?","1. Interleukin-1 (IL-1): IL-1 is a proinflammatory cytokine that is released in response to infection or injury. It acts on the hypothalamus to induce fever as part of the body's response to infection.

2. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha): TNF-alpha is another proinflammatory cytokine that can induce fever by acting on the hypothalamus.

3. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2): PGE2 is a lipid mediator that is released in response to infection or inflammation. It acts on the hypothalamus to induce fever by resetting the temperature set-point.",PGE2,Relevant
35,"A 33-year-old individual presents to the emergency department after an episode of syncope. They state that for the past month ever since starting a new job they have experienced an episode of syncope or near-syncope every morning while getting dressed. The patient states that they now get dressed, shave, and put on their tie sitting down to avoid falling when they faint. They have never had this before and are concerned it is stress from their new job as they have been unemployed for the past 5 years. They are wondering if they can get a note for work since they were unable to head in today secondary to their presentation. The patient has no significant past medical history and is otherwise healthy. Their temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 122/83 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. Cardiopulmonary and neurologic exams are within normal limits. An initial ECG and laboratory values are unremarkable as well. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?","1. *1* Vasovagal Syncope: The patient's description of syncope precipitated by specific triggers (getting dressed, shaving, putting on tie), especially in a young individual without significant medical history, is highly suggestive of vasovagal syncope. This type of syncope is often triggered by emotional stress, pain, or orthostatic stress, like when standing for a long time while getting dressed.

2. *2* Orthostatic Hypotension: While orthostatic hypotension could be a consideration, the fact that the patient's symptoms are specifically provoked by a certain morning routine point more towards vasovagal syncope. Orthostatic hypotension typically presents with syncopal episodes on standing up and not necessarily related to specific activities.

3. *3* Anxiety: Anxiety could potentially cause syncope in the setting of a vasovagal response to stress. However, given the specific trigger of the morning routine and the absence of a known history of anxiety in this patient, vasovagal syncope would be a more likely explanation.",Carotid hypersensitivity syndrome,Relevant.

Resuscitation is started with IV fluids and cross-matched blood arranged. Vitals are stabilized after resuscitation and blood transfusion. The hemoglobin is 7.6 g/dL, hematocrit is 30%, BUN is 33 mg/dL, and PT/aPTT is within normal limits. A nasogastric tube is inserted, which drains bile without blood. Rectal examination and proctoscopy reveal massive active bleeding, without any obvious hemorrhoids or fissure. The physician estimates the rate of bleeding at 2-3 mL/min. What is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?","1. Perform an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the most appropriate next step in determining the source of the bleeding in this patient. Since the nasogastric tube has drained bile without any evidence of blood, the likely source of bleeding is in the upper gastrointestinal tract, possibly from an upper gastrointestinal ulcer or varices.

2. Angiography: Angiography may be considered as the second step to localize the site of hemorrhage and its vascular source, especially if endoscopy is inconclusive or not readily available.

3. Colonoscopy: Colonoscopy may be considered as a diagnostic tool; however, given the brisk active bleeding from the rectum and the patient's presentation, an upper gastrointestinal source of bleeding is more likely.",Mesenteric angiography,Relevant.
42,"A 50-year-old individual is brought to the hospital after being found unresponsive in bed in the morning. They are declared dead on arrival in the emergency room. Their partner states that they always had uncontrolled hypertension despite being on multiple medications. An autopsy is performed, and the cause of their death is found to be a hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia. On microscopic examination, the branches of the renal artery have concentric endothelial proliferation with prominent narrowing of the lumen resulting in focal ischemia and hemorrhage of the renal parenchyma. Which of the following is most likely related to the findings in this patient?","1. **Renal artery stenosis:** Renal artery stenosis can lead to decreased blood flow to the kidneys, resulting in ischemic injury and hypertension. This hypertension can lead to complications such as hemorrhage in the basal ganglia.

2. **Atherosclerosis:** Atherosclerosis is a common condition that can result in narrowing of the renal arteries, leading to reduced blood flow to the kidneys. This can result in hypertension, which can predispose individuals to complications such as cerebral hemorrhage.

3. **Renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia:** Renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia is a condition characterized by abnormal cell development in the walls of the renal artery, leading to narrowing of the artery. This narrowing can result in decreased blood flow to the kidneys and subsequent hypertension, which can contribute to complications such as cerebral hemorrhage.",Raised renin level in the blood,Relevant
43,"A 36-year-old individual in their 12th week of pregnancy presents to their obstetrician with vaginal bleeding. They also report 3 episodes of non-bloody, non-bilious emesis. They have failed to show up for their last 2 prenatal visits due to work. Their past medical history is notable for obesity and type I diabetes mellitus. Their family history is notable for ovarian cancer in their mother and endometrial cancer in their maternal grandmother. On examination, the uterus is at 16 weeks in size and there is mild tenderness to palpation on the right suprapubic region. A transvaginal ultrasound in this patient would most likely reveal which of the following?","1. Ectopic pregnancy: Given the history of right-sided suprapubic tenderness in a pregnant patient with vaginal bleeding and emesis, along with the finding of the uterus measuring larger than expected for the gestational age, an ectopic pregnancy is a significant concern. This could indicate a tubal ectopic pregnancy, which is a medical emergency requiring prompt intervention.

2. Miscarriage: Miscarriage is another common cause of vaginal bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy. It would be essential to rule out this possibility, especially given the history of intermittent bleeding and emesis in this patient.

3. Ovarian cyst or torsion: Given the history of right-sided suprapubic tenderness and possible risk factors like obesity and family history of ovarian cancer, an ovarian cyst or torsion is also a consideration. This may need to be assessed with further imaging studies like ultrasound to differentiate from other possible causes of the presented symptoms.",Intrauterine cystic mass,Relevant

There is an eczematous rash on the face and bilateral upper extremities. Their face has thickened skin with a wide-set nose. This patient's condition is most likely caused by a mutation in which of the following genes?","1. **FLG gene**: A mutation in the Filaggrin (FLG) gene is associated with atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema. This gene plays a crucial role in maintaining the skin barrier function, and mutations can lead to dry, itchy rashes.

2. **STAT3 gene**: Mutations in the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) gene can cause Hyper IgE Syndrome, which presents with eczema, recurrent skin and lung infections, and elevated serum IgE levels. However, given the described presentation focusing on the skin, FLG gene mutation is more likely.

3. **CARD11 gene**: Mutations in the Caspase Recruitment Domain family, member 11 (CARD11) gene can cause immunodeficiency with atopic dermatitis.

Slit lamp examination shows bilateral lens subluxation in the superotemporal direction. The individual's older sibling is also tall, has hyperflexible joints, and has hyperelastic skin. However, they do not have lens subluxation or an arched palate. Which of the following genetic principles accounts for the phenotypical differences seen in this pair of siblings?","*1* 1. Variable expressivity: This genetic principle explains how individuals with the same genetic mutation may exhibit different symptoms or severity of a genetic disorder. In this case, both siblings likely have Marfan syndrome, which is characterized by tall stature, hyperflexible joints, lens subluxation, and other features. However, the variable expressivity of the mutation results in different phenotypical manifestations between the siblings. 

*2* 2. Incomplete penetrance: This genetic principle refers to individuals who have a genetic mutation but do not show any symptoms of the associated disorder. In this case, both siblings likely have the genetic mutation for Marfan syndrome, but only one is showing the clinical features while the other is not. However, the presence of varying clinical features between the siblings suggests that variable expressivity is a more likely explanation.

*3* 3. Genetic heterogeneity: This genetic principle refers to different genetic mutations that can cause the same or similar clinical features. While there is some genetic heterogeneity in connective tissue disorders like Marfan syndrome, the clinical scenario described is more consistent with variable expressivity as the primary explanation for the phenotypical differences between the siblings.",Variable expressivity,Accurate.
