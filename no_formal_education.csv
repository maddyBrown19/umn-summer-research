0,"This man, who is 85 years old, has a disease called Parkinson’s, and his symptoms have come back over the past few months. He has been given different drugs for the past 20 years, but now his symptoms get worse when it's almost time for his next dose of medication. Lately, his movements have been slow and hard to start voluntarily. He has a history of hypertension and was diagnosed 10 years ago. He currently takes levodopa/carbidopa, rasagiline, aspirin, and captopril. His pulse is 70 beats per minute, he breathes 15 times per minute, his blood pressure is 130/76 mm Hg, and his temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F). During a physical exam, the doctor saw that he had a tremor in his hand that stopped when he moved it. His arm muscles were stiff, and he resisted when the doctor moved his joints. When asked to walk, he struggled with the first step and walked stooped over with short, fast steps. Lab tests showed:
Sugar in his blood after fasting: 97 mg/dL
Sodium: 141 mEq/L
Potassium: 4.0 mEq/L
Chloride: 100 mEq/L
Total cholesterol: 190 mg/dL
Good cholesterol (HDL): 42 mg/dL
Bad cholesterol (LDL): 70 mg/dL
Triglycerides: 184 mg/dL
He was given a new drug to help his current Parkinson's medication work better. What do you think is the new drug he started taking?","1. Entacapone - Entacapone is a COMT inhibitor that can help prolong the effects of levodopa by preventing its breakdown in the body, leading to better control of Parkinson's symptoms.

2. Selegiline - Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor that can also help extend the effects of levodopa by preventing its breakdown, potentially improving symptom control in Parkinson's disease.

3. Amantadine - Amantadine is a medication that can help improve Parkinson's symptoms such as tremors and stiffness by increasing dopamine release in the brain and blocking glutamate receptors. It is commonly used in combination with other Parkinson's medications to enhance their effectiveness.",Entacapone,Relevant

Vaginal atrophy: The symptoms described by the woman, such as pain during sex, vaginal dryness, irregular periods, and an atrophic cervix and vagina, are suggestive of vaginal atrophy. This condition can occur in women of any age but is more common in menopausal women due to declining estrogen levels. The history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia as a child may have contributed to hormonal imbalances leading to this condition.

2. Premature ovarian insufficiency (premature menopause): The symptoms of hot flashes, fatigue, irregular periods, and negative pregnancy test, despite being only 23 years old, raise suspicion for premature ovarian insufficiency (also known as premature menopause). The past history of leukemia and possibly its treatment may have caused damage to the ovaries, resulting in the early onset of menopausal symptoms.

3. Hormonal imbalances: The past medical history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and its treatment may have caused long-term hormonal imbalances in the woman, leading to the symptoms described.

He says the pain is an 8 out of 10 in how bad it feels, it's sharp, in the middle of the chest and behind the breastbone, and it spreads to his back and shoulders. He also feels like throwing up but hasn't actually vomited. He hasn't had a fever, chills, or a long-lasting cough. He has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, and takes lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, simvastatin, and metformin for these conditions. He's been smoking for 30 years and drinks alcohol on the weekends. His family has a history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart attacks in his dad and uncle. His blood pressure is really high. He's sweaty. When his heart is listened to, a certain type of sound is heard. His chest X-ray shows a widened middle part of his chest. The heart's electricity test shows some non-specific changes. They started giving him morphine and beta-blockers. Do you know what's probably going on with him?","*1* This presentation is concerning for an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), specifically a type known as an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) given the sudden onset of severe chest pain, radiation to the back and shoulders, associated nausea, and strong family history of heart disease. The fact that the patient has risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking further supports this diagnosis. The elevated blood pressure, diaphoresis (sweating), and specific sound heard on auscultation of the heart (likely a new murmur) all raise concern for complications such as heart failure or cardiogenic shock following the heart attack.

*2* Another possibility to consider is an aortic dissection, given the combination of severe chest pain that radiates to the back, high blood pressure, and widened mediastinum seen on chest X-ray. Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention, and the presence of risk factors such as hypertension and family history of heart conditions increase the likelihood of this diagnosis.

*3* Additionally, given the patient's constellation of symptoms and risk factors, pulmonary embolism could also be on the differential diagnosis. Symptoms such as pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and a recent history of immobilization (such as watching TV) could suggest this condition. However, the absence of typical signs like hemoptysis (coughing up blood) or significant risk factors (like recent surgery or travel history) makes it less likely than the other potential diagnoses in this case.",Aortic dissection,Relevant.
24,Why does this man have trouble seeing things and being too sensitive to light if he's been taking antipsychotic medicine for a long time?,"*1* An adverse effect of the antipsychotic medication known as ocular side effects, such as blurred vision and photosensitivity, can lead to difficulty seeing things and being sensitive to light.

AMA is a highly specific marker for primary biliary cirrhosis.

*2* Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels are also more likely to be seen in primary biliary cirrhosis than primary sclerosing cholangitis.

*3* Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) may be present in both primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, but they are more commonly associated with primary biliary cirrhosis.",Anti-mitochondrial antibody,Relevant
34,"Can you tell me what could be causing the breathing problems of the man who is 68 years old and has a history of diabetes, high blood pressure, Paget disease, and smoking?","1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the most likely cause of breathing problems in a 68-year-old man with a history of diabetes, high blood pressure, Paget disease, and smoking. COPD is a common lung condition that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and is often caused by smoking and exposure to harmful particles or gases. Patients with COPD may experience shortness of breath, wheezing, and a chronic cough.

2. Congestive heart failure (CHF) could also be responsible for the breathing problems in this patient. CHF occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to fluid buildup in the lungs and difficulty breathing. Patients with diabetes and high blood pressure are at an increased risk for developing CHF.

3. Pneumonia is another possible cause of breathing problems in this individual.

38,"A man, 49 years old, goes to the hospital emergency room because he has had a lot of stomach pain for a week. The pain gets worse after he eats and he has thrown up two times during this week. He had to stay at the hospital two times before for acute pancreatitis in the last year, with the most recent time being 2 months ago. Nobody else in his family has been seriously sick. The only medicine he takes is a vitamin pill. He used to drink five beers every day for many years, but he stopped a month ago. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), his heart rate is 98 beats per minute, and his blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. He looks like he is in pain. When the doctor presses on his upper stomach, he feels sore. A special x-ray of his stomach shows a 6-centimeter oval pocket of fluid attached to his pancreas. What should the doctors do next?","1. The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis, which is a known risk factor for the development of pancreatic pseudocysts. The presence of a 6-centimeter oval pocket of fluid attached to his pancreas on the x-ray is consistent with a pancreatic pseudocyst. The next step in management would be to consult a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and treatment options.

2. Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and recent cessation, it is important to assess his current alcohol intake and provide counseling and support for alcohol cessation. Alcohol cessation is crucial in the management of pancreatitis and may help reduce the risk of recurrent episodes.

3. Considering the patient's symptoms of severe stomach pain, vomiting, and soreness on palpation of the upper stomach, it is important to monitor his clinical status closely for signs of worsening pancreatitis or potential complications such as infection or bleeding from the pseudocyst. Close monitoring and frequent reassessment of the patient's condition are essential in the management of pancreatic pseudocysts.",CT-guided percutaneous drainage,Inaccurate
39,"What should be done next for the baby with a fever, fast heartbeat, low blood pressure, and clitoromegaly, whose lab results show a normal blood count, slightly high potassium, low carbon dioxide, and normal kidney function?","*1* The baby likely has congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), specifically the salt-wasting type, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical intervention. CAH is a genetic disorder that affects the adrenal glands' ability to produce cortisol and aldosterone. The symptoms of low blood pressure, clitoromegaly in females, and electrolyte imbalances (high potassium, low carbon dioxide) are indicative of CAH. Treatment involves replacing the deficient hormones and managing electrolyte imbalances. Immediate referral to a pediatric endocrinologist is crucial.

*2* Another possible diagnosis to consider is sepsis, which can present with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. However, the presence of clitoromegaly and the electrolyte imbalances make CAH a more likely diagnosis. Sepsis requires immediate treatment with antibiotics and supportive care.

*3* Adrenal crisis due to adrenal insufficiency could be another consideration, given the symptoms of fever, fast heartbeat, and low blood pressure. However, the presence of clitoromegaly points more towards CAH. Adrenal crisis requires immediate administration of intravenous steroids and fluids.",Hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy,Accurate
40,Why are the cells causing the raised area on the man's arm after the tuberculosis skin test different from other cells?,"*1* The cells causing the raised area on the man's arm after the tuberculosis skin test are likely activated T cells, specifically T lymphocytes that are part of the immune system's response to the tuberculin protein injected during the test.

*2* These cells are different from other cells in the sense that they have been primed and sensitized to the tuberculin protein due to a previous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis or the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine.

*3* The T cells causing the raised area are part of a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, which involves the recruitment and activation of immune cells to the injection site, leading to inflammation and the characteristic induration or raised bump.",They need thymus for their maturation.,Relevant

42,"Why is a 23-year-old man coming to the doctor with chest pain that gets worse when he breathes in and gets better when he leans forward, along with nausea and muscle pain?","*1*  Pericarditis: Pericarditis is the most likely cause of these symptoms in a young man. It is an inflammation of the sac around the heart, the pericardium, and can cause chest pain that worsens with inspiration, improves with leaning forward, and can be associated with nausea and muscle pain.

*2*  Pleurisy: Pleurisy is inflammation of the pleura, the lining around the lungs, and can cause chest pain that worsens with deep breathing. However, pleurisy is less likely to cause relief with leaning forward compared to pericarditis.

*3*  Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): GERD can present with chest pain and nausea, but is less likely to worsen with breathing in or improve with leaning forward.",Acute viral infection,Relevant

She is also having trouble falling asleep and can't concentrate at work. Sometimes she thinks about hurting herself, but she doesn't have a plan to do so. She doesn't feel like eating much. The doctor checked her thyroid and found her Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level to be 3.5 uU/mL. She was given a medicine called amitriptyline and went back for a check-up after 2 weeks. She said she feels a bit better emotionally and doesn't have headaches anymore, but she feels dizzy when she gets up from bed in the morning or stands up from her desk at work. What is the reason for her feeling lightheaded after taking amitriptyline?","*1* The most likely reason for the lady feeling lightheaded after taking amitriptyline is orthostatic hypotension, which is a drop in blood pressure that occurs when going from lying down or sitting to standing up.

*2* Another possible reason for feeling lightheaded after taking amitriptyline is dehydration, as some medications, including amitriptyline, can cause increased urination which can lead to dehydration.
