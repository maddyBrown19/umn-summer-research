*3* The woman might also be experiencing a side effect of the procedure to treat the heart attack, such as a complication related to the use of medications or a possible infection that could affect blood circulation to the toes.",Acute kidney injury,Relevant.
41,"A 49-year-old woman who has diabetes, high blood pressure, cervical cancer, and high cholesterol is feeling pain while peeing and pees a lot. She hasn't had this before, but her mom gets it a lot. She smokes and drinks wine. Her test results show signs of infection in her pee. What doesn't make a UTI complicated for her?","*1*  Drinking water and unsweetened cranberry juice to help flush out the infection.

*2*  Avoiding alcohol and caffeinated beverages to prevent further irritation of the bladder.

*3*  Taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen to alleviate discomfort.",The causative organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Inaccurate
42,Why did the man come to the hospital after having a big seizure?,"*1* The man came to the hospital after having a big seizure likely because he needs immediate medical attention to stabilize his condition and prevent further seizures or complications. 
*2* Another reason could be that his seizure was caused by an underlying medical condition such as epilepsy, brain injury, infection, or a metabolic disorder which requires further evaluation and treatment. 
*3* It is also possible that the man needed to be seen by healthcare professionals to receive medication adjustments, counseling, or education on seizure management and prevention.",Small cell lung carcinoma,Inaccurate.
43,"Why is this 7-year-old boy in the emergency room with sudden belly pain, who was diagnosed with a pee infection three days ago, having a stomach that hurts when touched, a slightly bigger spleen, and yellow eyes? His blood results show low hemoglobin, with big red blood cells, and high bilirubin levels. What could be causing all of this?","*1* This child is showing signs of acute hepatitis. The symptoms of sudden belly pain, enlarged spleen, yellow eyes (jaundice), and the abnormal liver function tests with high bilirubin levels point towards a liver problem. The low hemoglobin and big red blood cells suggest hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells) which can occur in hepatitis.

*2* This child may have a complication of their UTI. It is possible that the kidney infection has progressed to involve the liver, leading to abdominal pain, jaundice, and the other symptoms described. The blood results are consistent with hemolysis, which can be a complication of severe infections.

*3* A rare possibility could be a genetic disorder such as hereditary spherocytosis. This disorder leads to fragile red blood cells that get destroyed more easily, causing anemia and jaundice. However, given the sudden onset of symptoms after the UTI diagnosis, acute hepatitis is a more likely cause.",Enzyme deficiency in red blood cells,Relevant
44,Why does this man have low sodium in his blood?,"*1*  The man may have a condition called Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH), where the body retains water excessively, leading to dilution of sodium levels in the blood.

*2*  The man may be taking diuretic medications, which can cause excessive excretion of sodium in the urine, leading to low sodium levels in the blood.

*3*  The man may have experienced excessive sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea, which can lead to sodium depletion in the body.",Physiologic ADH (vasopressin) secretion,Relevant.
45,"What is wrong with the woman who noticed her body swelling and frothy urine 4 days ago, has HIV, and is currently taking abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine?","1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to tenofovir toxicity
2. Nephrotic syndrome due to HIV-associated nephropathy
3. Acute interstitial nephritis due to abacavir or dolutegravir",Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,Inaccurate
46,Why is the doctor checking the bone marrow of a man who is 62 years old and has been bleeding easily and losing weight for 4 months?,"*1* The doctor is checking the bone marrow to investigate the possibility of a hematologic disorder, such as leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, which can cause symptoms like easy bruising, bleeding, and weight loss in older adults. 

*2* The doctor may also be checking for the presence of abnormal cells in the bone marrow, which can help diagnose conditions like lymphoma or multiple myeloma which can present with similar symptoms.

*3* Bone marrow aspiration or biopsy may also be performed to rule out other potential causes of the symptoms such as anemia or other blood disorders.",Neoplastic lymphocytes that stain positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase,Relevant
47,"What's wrong with the man who's been biking a lot since he was 20 and now has a weak right hand, trouble feeling in his pinky and ring fingers, and difficulty extending those fingers?","1. Ulnar nerve entrapment: This condition commonly occurs in individuals who engage in activities that put pressure on the ulnar nerve, such as biking, leading to symptoms like weakness in the hand and difficulty extending the fingers.
2. Carpal tunnel syndrome: This condition can cause similar symptoms, but it typically affects the median nerve and may not be as common in individuals who engage in biking.
3. Cubital tunnel syndrome: This condition affects the ulnar nerve as it passes through the cubital tunnel in the elbow, leading to similar symptoms as described in the scenario.",Ulnar nerve,Relevant.
48,"A 12-year-old boy develops muscle weakness and pain, vomiting, seizures, and severe headache. Additionally, he presents with hemiparesis on one side of the body. A muscle biopsy shows 'ragged red fibers'. What do you think about how this sickness is passed down in families?","*1* This presentation is consistent with mitochondrial myopathy, specifically mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS syndrome), an inherited mitochondrial disorder caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. It is passed down in families through maternal inheritance due to the fact that mitochondria are inherited from the mother's egg.

*2* Another consideration could be Kearns-Sayre syndrome, another mitochondrial disorder that typically presents with similar symptoms in childhood, with ragged-red fibers seen on muscle biopsy.

*3* Lastly, Pearson syndrome, a rare mitochondrial disorder typically presenting in infancy with macrocytic anemia and pancreatic insufficiency, could also be a potential differential diagnosis given the mitochondrial involvement and inheritance pattern in this case.",It is transmitted only through the mother.,Accurate
49,"Why does the boy feel weak and tired and have muscle cramps, stomach pain, and tingling sensations?","*1* The boy may have an electrolyte imbalance, such as low levels of potassium, calcium, or magnesium, which can result in muscle weakness, cramps, and tingling sensations. 

*2* Another possibility is that the boy may have a viral infection, such as influenza or mononucleosis, which can cause symptoms like weakness, tiredness, stomach pain, and muscle cramps.

*3* Additionally, the boy may be experiencing symptoms of dehydration, which can lead to muscle weakness, stomach pain, and fatigue.",Hydrochlorothiazide,Relevant
