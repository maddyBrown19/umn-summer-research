46,"A man aged 54 was taken to the emergency room after a car hit him while he was riding a bike. He didn't wear a helmet. Even with life-saving help, he passed away 2 hours later due to a severe brain bleed. The heart autopsy shows the left ventricular wall thickened overall with the ventricular chamber getting narrower. What could have caused these heart changes?","1. *Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy*: This condition involves the thickening of the heart muscle, specifically the left ventricular wall, leading to a decreased chamber size. It is a common cause of sudden cardiac death among young people and can be undiagnosed until an event like this occurs.

2. *Long-standing Hypertension*: Chronic high blood pressure can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy, resulting in thickening of the ventricular wall and narrowing of the chamber. Over time, this can weaken the heart muscle and lead to complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

3. *Atherosclerotic Heart Disease*: This condition involves the buildup of plaque in the arteries supplying blood to the heart muscle. Over time, it can cause the heart muscle to thicken in response to decreased blood flow, leading to a narrowed chamber. In severe cases, this can result in heart attacks or sudden cardiac events.",Chronic hypertension,Relevant.
47,"Why is the doctor checking this woman's weight gain, irregular periods, high blood pressure, central obesity, coloring on her palms, and scars on her belly?","*1* The doctor is checking for symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, a hormonal disorder caused by high levels of the hormone cortisol in the body. The symptoms mentioned (weight gain, irregular periods, high blood pressure, central obesity, coloring on the palms, and scars on the belly) can all be associated with this condition. 

*2* The doctor may also be checking for signs of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), which can present with irregular periods, weight gain, and changes in skin coloring. 

*3* Another possibility is the doctor is evaluating for Metabolic Syndrome, a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.

48,Why is the baby turning blue and getting tired easily and sweaty while drinking milk?,"*1* The baby may have a congenital heart defect, which can cause poor oxygenation of the blood leading to cyanosis (blueness), fatigue, and sweating during feeding.

*2* Another possibility is a condition called Tetralogy of Fallot, a combination of four heart defects that can lead to decreased oxygen levels in the blood and symptoms such as cyanosis, fatigue, and sweating with feeding.

*3* The symptoms could also be due to a milk allergy, causing difficulty breathing and decreased oxygen levels in the blood leading to cyanosis, fatigue, and sweating during feeding.",Degree of right ventricular outflow obstruction,Relevant
49,"A man who had an operation on his spine is feeling pain in his belly after one month. The doctor checked and found a lump above his pubic area. The man can't feel as much below his belly button. Tests showed his bladder muscles are contracting at the same time as the muscles around his urethra. When the doctor put a tube into his bladder, it drained out 900 milliliters of urine. What medicine should he take for his peeing problems?","*1* The most plausible answer is oxybutynin, which is commonly used to treat bladder muscle problems such as overactive bladder, which can cause symptoms like urinary urgency, frequency, and incontinence. It helps to relax the bladder muscles and reduce contraction.

*2* The second best answer is mirabegron, which is another medication used for overactive bladder. It works by relaxing the bladder muscle and increasing the bladder's capacity to hold urine.

*3* The third best answer is tolterodine, which is also a medication used to treat symptoms of an overactive bladder by relaxing the bladder muscle and reducing sudden muscle contractions.",Prazosin,Relevant
